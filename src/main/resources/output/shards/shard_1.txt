i had always thought jack gisburn rather a cheap genius though a good fellow enough so it was no great surprise to me to hear that in the height of his glory he had dropped his painting married a rich widow and established himself in a villa on the riviera though i rather thought it would have been rome or florence
the height of his glory that was what the women called it i can hear mrs gideon thwing his last chicago sitter deploring his unaccountable abdication of course it s going to send the value of my picture way up but i don t think of that mr rickham the loss to arrt is all i think of the word on mrs thwing s lips multiplied its rs as though they were reflected in an endless vista of mirrors and it was not only the mrs thwings who mourned had not the exquisite hermia croft at the last grafton gallery show stopped me before gisburn s moon dancers to say with tears in her eyes we shall not look upon its like again
well even through the prism of hermia s tears i felt able to face the fact with equanimity poor jack gisburn the women had made him it was fitting that they should mourn him among his own sex fewer regrets were heard and in his own trade hardly a murmur professional jealousy perhaps if it were the honour of the craft was vindicated by little claude nutley who in all good faith brought out in the burlington a very handsome obituary on jack one of those showy articles stocked with random technicalities that i have heard i won t say by whom compared to gisburn s painting and so his resolve being apparently irrevocable the discussion gradually died out and as mrs thwing had predicted the price of gisburns went up
it was not till three years later that in the course of a few weeks idling on the riviera it suddenly occurred to me to wonder why gisburn had given up his painting on reflection it really was a tempting problem to accuse his wife would have been too easy his fair sitters had been denied the solace of saying that mrs gisburn had dragged him down for mrs gisburn as such had not existed till nearly a year after jack s resolve had been taken it might be that he had married her since he liked his ease because he didn t want to go on painting but it would have been hard to prove that he had given up his painting because he had married her
of course if she had not dragged him down she had equally as miss croft contended failed to lift him up she had not led him back to the easel to put the brush into his hand again what a vocation for a wife but mrs gisburn appeared to have disdained it and i felt it might be interesting to find out why
the desultory life of the riviera lends itself to such purely academic speculations and having on my way to monte carlo caught a glimpse of jack s balustraded terraces between the pines i had myself borne thither the next day
i found the couple at tea beneath their palm trees and mrs gisburn s welcome was so genial that in the ensuing weeks i claimed it frequently it was not that my hostess was interesting on that point i could have given miss croft the fullest reassurance it was just because she was not interesting if i may be pardoned the bull that i found her so for jack all his life had been surrounded by interesting women they had fostered his art it had been reared in the hot house of their adulation and it was therefore instructive to note what effect the deadening atmosphere of mediocrity i quote miss croft was having on him
i have mentioned that mrs gisburn was rich and it was immediately perceptible that her husband was extracting from this circumstance a delicate but substantial satisfaction it is as a rule the people who scorn money who get most out of it and jack s elegant disdain of his wife s big balance enabled him with an appearance of perfect good breeding to transmute it into objects of art and luxury to the latter i must add he remained relatively indifferent but he was buying renaissance bronzes and eighteenth century pictures with a discrimination that bespoke the amplest resources
money s only excuse is to put beauty into circulation was one of the axioms he laid down across the sevres and silver of an exquisitely appointed luncheon table when on a later day i had again run over from monte carlo and mrs gisburn beaming on him added for my enlightenment jack is so morbidly sensitive to every form of beauty
poor jack it had always been his fate to have women say such things of him the fact should be set down in extenuation what struck me now was that for the first time he resented the tone i had seen him so often basking under similar tributes was it the conjugal note that robbed them of their savour no for oddly enough it became apparent that he was fond of mrs gisburn fond enough not to see her absurdity it was his own absurdity he seemed to be wincing under his own attitude as an object for garlands and incense
my dear since i ve chucked painting people don t say that stuff about me they say it about victor grindle was his only protest as he rose from the table and strolled out onto the sunlit terrace
i glanced after him struck by his last word victor grindle was in fact becoming the man of the moment as jack himself one might put it had been the man of the hour the younger artist was said to have formed himself at my friend s feet and i wondered if a tinge of jealousy underlay the latter s mysterious abdication but no for it was not till after that event that the rose dubarry drawing rooms had begun to display their grindles
i turned to mrs gisburn who had lingered to give a lump of sugar to her spaniel in the dining room
why has he chucked painting i asked abruptly
she raised her eyebrows with a hint of good humoured surprise
oh he doesn t have to now you know and i want him to enjoy himself she said quite simply
i looked about the spacious white panelled room with its famille verte vases repeating the tones of the pale damask curtains and its eighteenth century pastels in delicate faded frames
has he chucked his pictures too i haven t seen a single one in the house
a slight shade of constraint crossed mrs gisburn s open countenance it s his ridiculous modesty you know he says they re not fit to have about he s sent them all away except one my portrait and that i have to keep upstairs
his ridiculous modesty jack s modesty about his pictures my curiosity was growing like the bean stalk i said persuasively to my hostess i must really see your portrait you know
