a work instruction introduced in 1996 requires government staff in the arbeits mter local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the federal ministry of labour and social affairs to mark companies owned by scientologists with the letter s where companies are suspected of having scientologist staff prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff government officials have publicised the names of individual scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses some businesspeople have placed advertisements in the press saying they are not scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma
due to concerns about possible government infiltration by scientologists applicants for civil service positions in bavaria are required to declare whether or not they are scientologists and a similar policy has been instituted in hesse companies tendering for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not scientologists in 2001 this requirement was changed and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that the technology of l ron hubbard will not be used in executing the contract when it became known that microsoft s windows 2000 operating system included a disk defragmenter developed by executive software international a company headed by a scientologist this caused concern among german government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage to assuage these concerns microsoft germany agreed to provide a means to disable the utility following letters of complaint about discrimination from scientology lawyers some american companies such as general electric ibm and ford motor company instructed their german subsidiaries to cease the use of protective declarations
the city state of hamburg set up a full time office dedicated to opposing scientology the scientology task force for the hamburg interior authority under the leadership of ursula caberta in 2005 in a case brought by a scientologist the federal administrative court of germany ordered the city of hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community finding that the practice infringed religious freedom in june 2008 the hamburg administrative court fined the city of hamburg 5 000 euros 7 000 for not complying with court instructions banning the use of sect filters internet links to sample filters to be used by businesses had continued to remain available eileen barker a professor of sociology at the london school of economics has noted that germany has gone further than any other western european country in restricting the civil rights of scientologists the hamburg task force was closed down in august 2010 as a result of budget cuts caberta moved to a position within the hamburg interior authority where she continues her work on scientology
scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties in germany such as the christian democratic union the christian social union of bavaria the social democratic party of germany and the free democratic party existing scientologist members of these parties have been purged according to time magazine scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in germany scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked in 1995 a sports scientist and former member of the german national fencing team was dismissed from his job at the german olympic fencing centre after he stated in an interview that he had enjoyed reading books by l ron hubbard and had participated in a course run by a scientologist management and communication consultancy firm thomas gottschalk a german tv presenter was falsely accused in 1993 of having taken part in scientology courses gottschalk responded by announcing that he had not and that he would henceforth cease all contact with a friend who had links to scientology in 2007 g nther oettinger the minister president of the german state of baden w rttemberg expressed concern that scientologist john travolta was to appear on gottschalk s programme and asked the zdf tv station to consider revoking the invitation the zdf said that uninviting travolta would cause greater damage and that scientology was not going to be discussed in the programme
in 2010 the bavarian administrative court ruled that a woman working in a children s daycare centre whose employment had been terminated when her ex husband identified her as a scientologist should be reinstated the woman had demonstrated to the court s satisfaction that her scientological beliefs were irrelevant to her work according to the agreement that concluded the case she promised not to use scientology methods in her work and to inform the children s parents of her membership in scientology
initiative to ban scientology
in march 2007 it was reported that german authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor scientology in response to the opening of a new scientology headquarters in berlin on december 7 2007 german federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti constitutional goals restricting essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment and asked germany s domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization
the move was criticized by german politicians from all sides of the political spectrum with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts sabine weber president of the church of scientology in berlin called the accusations unrealistic and absurd and said that the german interior ministers evaluation was based on a few sentences out of 500 000 pages of scientological literature she added i can also find hundreds of quotes in the bible that are totalitarian but that doesn t mean i will demand the ban of christianity
in november 2008 the government abandoned its attempts to ban scientology after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity the report by the bfv cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban scientology doubtful first the bfv report stated there was no evidence that scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization there were german churches and missions a german board german bylaws and no evidence that the organization was totally remote controlled from the united states a foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a german one the second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was scientology s aggressive opposition to the constitution here the report found that scientology s behaviour gave no grounds to assume that scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow germany s free and democratic basic order neither its bylaws nor any other utterances supported the conclusion that the organization had criminal aims the bfv also considered whether there were grounds to act against the church of scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning
commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt ehrhart k rting berlin s interior minister said this organization pursues goals through its writings its concept and its disrespect for minorities that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution but they put very little of this into practice the appraisal of the government at the moment is that scientology is a lousy organization but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to the church of scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision describing it as the only one possible monitoring of scientology s activities by the german intelligence services continues
in february 2009 the berlin administrative court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the berlin scientology headquarters warning passers by of the potential dangers scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom should be removed the decision was upheld in july 2009 by the upper administrative court of berlin brandenburg which ruled that the poster violated scientologists basic religious rights
criticism of germany s stance
the united states media while generally reporting negatively on scientology in domestic news has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards scientology in relation to germany richard cohen for example writing in the washington post said in 1996 scientology might be one weird religion but the german reaction to it is weirder still not to mention disturbing alan cowell writing in the new york times wrote in 1997 that the german response to scientology motivated by officials fear that scientology was a totalitarian movement growing like the nazi party from inconsequential beginnings was itself redolent of the nazi era s authoritarianism
the u s department of state has repeatedly claimed that germany s actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of scientologists individual rights posed by sect filters the u s department of state began to include the issue of scientology in germany in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the church of scientology and the u s internal revenue service through which scientology gained the status of a tax exempt religion in the united states that decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the church of scientology in washington using paid lobbyists the state department s 1996 human rights report on germany released in january 1997 warned that artists and businesses with scientology connections may face boycotts and discrimination sometimes with government approval past targets of such actions had included scientologist actors tom cruise and john travolta as well as jazz pianist chick corea
also in january 1997 an open letter to then chancellor helmut kohl appeared published as a newspaper advertisement in the international herald tribune drawing parallels between the organized oppression of scientologists in germany and nazi policies espoused by germany in the 1930s the letter was conceived and paid for by hollywood lawyer bertram fields whose clients have included tom cruise and john travolta and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the u s entertainment industry including the top executives of mgm warner bros paramount universal and sony pictures entertainment as well as actors dustin hoffman and goldie hawn director oliver stone writers mario puzo and gore vidal and talk show host larry king it echoed similar parallels drawn by the church of scientology itself which until then had received scant notice and was followed by lobbying efforts of scientology celebrities in washington
u s department of state spokesman nicholas burns rejected the nazi comparisons in the open letter as outrageous and distanced the u s government from nazi comparisons made by the church of scientology saying we have criticized the germans on this but we aren t going to support the scientologists terror tactics against the german government chancellor kohl commenting on the letter said that those who signed it don t know a thing about germany and don t want to know german officials argued that the whole fuss was cranked up by the scientologists to achieve what we won t give them tax exempt status as a religion this is intimidation pure and simple officials explained that precisely because of germany s nazi past germany took a determined stance against all radical cults and sects including right wing nazi groups and not just against scientology kohl s christian democratic union party denounced the letter as absurd and cited german court rulings stating that scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a contemptuous cartel of oppression
in february 1997 a united states immigration court judge granted asylum to a german scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland in april 1997 john travolta met personally with u s president bill clinton at a conference in philadelphia travolta later said clinton assured him that he would really love to help with the issue over in germany with scientology according to travolta clinton recalled that he had a roommate years ago who was a scientologist and had really liked him and respected his views on it stating that scientologists were given an unfair hand in germany and that he wanted to fix it in september 1997 john travolta chick corea and fellow scientologist isaac hayes were heard by the commission on security and cooperation in europe csce also known as the helsinki commission voicing their complaints about the treatment of scientologists in germany and had a briefing with united states national security advisor sandy berger whom clinton had assigned to be the administration s scientology point person the german ambassador responded with a letter to the csce stating that the german government had come to the conclusion that scientology s pseudo scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals mental and physical health and that it exploits its members adding that membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency to financial ruin and even to suicide in addition there are indications that scientology poses a threat to germany s basic political principles
a united nations report in april 1998 raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect filters however it rejected the comparison of the treatment of scientologists with that of jews during the nazi era
in 2000 the german stern magazine published the results of its investigation of the asylum case it asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her asylum application ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a scientologist had in fact been written by fellow scientologists at her request and that of scientology s office of special affairs and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax evasion at the time she applied for asylum on a 2000 visit to clearwater florida ursula caberta of the scientology task force for the hamburg interior authority likewise alleged that the asylum case had been part of an orchestrated effort by scientology undertaken for political gain and a spectacular abuse of the u s system german expatriate scientologists resident in clearwater in turn accused caberta of stoking a hate campaign in germany that had ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of scientologists and maintained that scientologists had not exaggerated their plight for political gain in the united states mark rathbun a former top church of scientology official said that although scientology had not orchestrated the case there would have been nothing improper if it had
in 2003 joachim g ntner writing in the swiss neue z rcher zeitung noted that gerhard besier a german christian theologian director of the hannah arendt institute for research into totalitarianism in dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from lund university sweden for his championing of religious freedom had been pressured to forego publication of his scientific study of scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the german media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards scientology g ntner concluded that alarmism had triumphed over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in germany s ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter
the u s department of state s 2012 report on religious freedom in germany published in 2013 stated that the status of the church of scientology remains in limbo the constitutional court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that scientology is a religion government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against scientology as a group and against its members four of the major political parties the christian democratic union christian social union social democratic party and free democratic party ban scientologists from party membership scientologists reported instances of governmental discrimination although courts at the state and federal level condemned the improper use of so called sect filters to blacklist and boycott scientologists they remained in use in the public sector sect filters typically asked potential new employees to confirm in writing that they had no contact with scientology did not participate in its training courses and rejected its doctrines catholic and protestant churches continued to oppose scientology publically sic although press reporting and public reactions to scientology decreased several private organizations issued warnings about after school study programs run by scientologists

japanese battleship asahi
asahi asahi was a pre dreadnought battleship built for the imperial japanese navy ijn in the late 1890s as japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself the ship was designed and built in the united kingdom shortly after her arrival in japan she became flagship of the standing fleet the ijn s primary combat fleet she participated in every major naval battle of the russo japanese war of 1904 05 and was lightly damaged during the battle of the yellow sea and the battle of tsushima asahi saw no combat during world war i although the ship participated in the siberian intervention in 1918
reclassified as a coastal defence ship in 1921 asahi was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the washington naval treaty after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship she was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in 1928 asahi was recommissioned in late 1937 after the start of the second sino japanese war and used to transport japanese troops in 1938 she was converted into a repair ship and based first at japanese occupied shanghai china and then cam ranh bay french indochina from late 1938 to 1941 the ship was transferred to occupied singapore in early 1942 to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in may she was sunk en route by the american submarine uss salmon although most of her crew survived
background
combat experience in the first sino japanese war of 1894 95 convinced the imperial japanese navy of weaknesses in the jeune cole naval philosophy which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships therefore japan promulgated a ten year naval build up in early 1896 to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core these ships were paid for from the 30 000 000 indemnity paid by china after losing the first sino japanese war as with the earlier fuji and shikishima classes japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships and turned again to the united kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme asahi the fifth japanese battleship to be built in britain was ordered from the clydebank engineering shipbuilding company shipyard in clydebank scotland in the 1897 annual naval programme
design and description

construction and career
asahi meaning rising sun a poetic name for japan from a stanza of waka poetry was laid down on 1 august 1898 in clydebank scotland by the clydebank engineering shipbuilding co and completed by john brown company which purchased the firm before asahi was completed she was launched on 13 march 1899 and completed on 31 july 1900 her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off southsea following sea trials the ship departed england after repairs in portsmouth on the day of her completion and arrived at yokosuka japan on 23 october 1900 asahi became flagship of the standing fleet on 22 may 1901 and was assigned to the 1st battleship division of the 1st fleet when the combined fleet was re formed on 28 december 1903
at the start of the russo japanese war asahi commanded by captain hikohachi yamada was assigned to the 1st division of the 1st fleet she participated in the battle of port arthur on 9 february 1904 when vice admiral t g heihachir led the 1st fleet in an attack on the russian ships of the pacific squadron anchored just outside port arthur t g had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was anticipating that the russians would be badly disorganized and weakened but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack the japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser boyarin which was patrolling offshore and alerted the russian defences t g chose to attack the russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the japanese eight inch 203 mm and six inch guns inflicted little damage on the russian ships which concentrated all their fire on the japanese ships with some effect although many ships on both sides were hit russian casualties numbered only 17 while the japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before t g disengaged asahi was not hit during the engagement
the ship participated in the action of 13 april when t g successfully lured out a portion of the pacific squadron including vice admiral stepan makarov s flagship the battleship petropavlovsk when makarov spotted the five battleships of the 1st division he turned back for port arthur and petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by the japanese the previous night the russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded and makarov was one of the 677 killed emboldened by his success t g resumed long range bombardment missions prompting the russians to lay more minefields which sank two japanese battleships the following month
during the battle of the yellow sea on 10 august asahi now commanded by captain tsunaakira nomoto was second in line of the column of japanese battleships behind mikasa and was one of the primary targets of the russian ships she was only hit by a single 12 inch shell that wounded two crewmen both guns in her aft 12 inch gun turret however were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels in turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships poltava and tsesarevich although both ships were only lightly damaged by the japanese shells which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact the ship made the critical hits of the battle however when two of her 12 inch shells struck the bridge of tsesarevich killing the russian squadron commander vice admiral wilgelm vitgeft two of his staff officers and the ship s quartermaster the ship s wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the russian ships into total confusion the second in command rear admiral prince pavel ukhtomsky eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to port arthur slightly more than two months later on 26 october asahi struck a mine off port arthur while on blockade duty severely damaged she was under repair at sasebo naval arsenal from november 1904 to april 1905 russian naval forces in the far east had been destroyed or neutralized by this time and the russians were forced to transfer ships from the baltic fleet that did not arrive until may
battle of tsushima
at the battle of tsushima on 27 may 1905 asahi again followed the battleship mikasa into combat this time against the second and third pacific squadrons mikasa opened fire at the battleship knyaz suvorov the russian flagship at 14 10 and was joined by asahi and the armoured cruiser azuma shortly afterwards within an hour the japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the russian ship badly wounded the fleet commander vice admiral zinovy rozhestvensky knocked out her rear 12 inch gun turret and jammed knyaz suvorov s steering so that she fell out of formation the russian ships were concentrating their fire on mikasa during the early part of the battle and asahi was not damaged during this time t g was able to cross the t of the russian squadrons knyaz suvorov s steering was later repaired but she blundered between the japanese and russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged asahi seems to have mostly engaged the battleships borodino and oryol in the late stages of the battle although fuji fired the shots that caused the borodino s magazines to explode and sink her asahi fired more twelve inch shells 142 than any other ship during the battle in total the ship was hit six times during the battle but none of them damaged her significantly while asahi s casualties are not precisely known the japanese only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all causes during the battle the battle was a total japanese victory with five russian battleships captured and incorporated into the ijn
captain w c pakenham the royal navy s official military observer under the anglo japanese alliance took notes of the battle s progress from a deck chair on asahi s exposed quarterdeck his report confirmed the superiority of japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the west
later career
in 1908 asahi was part of the japanese fleet that escorted the american great white fleet through japanese waters during its round the globe voyage the ship was assigned to the 1st fleet in 1908 and 1910 11 asahi became a gunnery training ship in 1914 and was re armed in 1917 with japanese guns replacing her original british made guns the same year she was assigned to the 5th division of the 3rd fleet in 1918 asahi became flagship of her division and participated in the japanese intervention in the russian civil war she escorted troop convoys to the russian far east and was guard ship at kamchatka from january to august 1918 asahi was reclassified as a first class coastal defence ship on 1 september 1921 and began disarmament in 1922 at yokosuka in compliance with the terms of the washington naval treaty she was reclassified as a training and submarine depot ship on 1 april 1923 and her disarmament was completed in july of that same year her displacement dropped to 11 441 long tons 11 625 t with the loss of her armour and guns and her speed was limited to 12 knots 22 km h 14 mph
the navy decided to convert asahi into a submarine salvage ship and she began the first stage of her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from february to august 1925 from 1926 to october 1927 the ship s 25 belleville boilers were replaced with four kanpon type ro boilers at kure naval arsenal one of her two funnels was also removed and two large lifting frames were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion the ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old german submarine 0 1 ex u 125 in may 1928 asahi was fitted with a 62 foot 4 inch 19 m compressed air aircraft catapult on her forecastle and successfully launched an e2n1 type 15 seaplane after repeated accidents the catapult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder on the completion of testing in 1928 asahi was placed in reserve
reclassified as a repair ship on 16 august 1937 asahi was taken out of reserve in november after the marco polo bridge incident that started the second sino japanese war and was used as a transport to land troops in an amphibious landing at hangzhou bay afterwards she began conversion at kure japan into a repair ship this was completed on 18 december 1938 asahi was fitted with a dummy wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in shanghai on 29 december in may 1939 she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between 29 may and 7 november 1940 she was transferred to camranh bay french indochina on 15 november 1940 and later transported the 11th base unit from kure to camranh bay 19 november 7 december 1941
from 13 march 1942 asahi was stationed at singapore and in april her crew performed repairs on the light cruiser naka which had been torpedoed by the submarine uss seawolf off christmas island departing singapore for kure on 22 may escorted by the subchaser ch 9 asahi was sighted by the submarine uss salmon on the night of 25 26 may 1942 100 miles 160 km southeast of cape padaran indochina of salmon s four torpedoes two hit the ship in her port central boiler room and aft spaces at 01 03 moments after being hit asahi sank at 10 00 n 110 00 e sixteen men were killed in the attack the ship s captain and 582 crewmen were rescued by ch 9

j c w beckham
john crepps wickliffe beckham august 5 1869 january 9 1940 was the 35th governor of kentucky and a united states senator from kentucky he was the state s first popularly elected senator following passage of the seventeenth amendment
descended from a prominent political family beckham was chosen as democrat william goebel s running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so goebel lost the election to republican william s taylor but the kentucky general assembly disputed the election results during the political wrangling that followed an unknown assassin shot goebel a day later the general assembly invalidated enough votes to give the election to goebel who was sworn into office on his deathbed taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the democratic majority in the general assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and beckham over the governorship beckham ultimately prevailed and taylor fled the state
following his term as governor beckham made a bid to become a u s senator his stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party and the seat went to republican william o bradley six years later beckham secured the seat by popular election but he lost his re election bid largely because of his pro temperance views and his opposition to women s suffrage though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades he never returned to elected office failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936 he died in louisville on january 9 1940
early life
j c w beckham was born at wickland near bardstown in nelson county kentucky son of william netherton and julia tevis wickliffe beckham his maternal grandfather charles a wickliffe was governor of kentucky from 1839 to 1840 and served as postmaster general in the administration of john tyler his uncle robert c wickliffe served as governor of louisiana
beckham obtained his early education at roseland academy in bardstown in 1881 he served as a page in the kentucky house of representatives at the age of 12 later he enrolled at central university now eastern kentucky university in richmond kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of 17 to support his widowed mother two years later he became principal of bardstown public schools serving from 1888 to 1893 concurrently he studied law at the university of kentucky where he earned his law degree in 1889 he was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in bardstown in 1893 he also served as president of the young democrats club of nelson county
political career
beckham s political career began in 1894 when he was elected without opposition to the kentucky house of representatives he served four consecutive terms and was speaker of the house in 1898 his final year in the house he also served as a delegate to every democratic national convention from 1900 to 1920
governor of kentucky
democrat william goebel chose beckham as his running mate in the kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899 goebel was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election and beckham s native nelson county was already committed to a rival candidate but friends of goebel assured him that beckham would be loyal to goebel s reform agenda whereas the two other men goebel was considering as running mates would stack the senate committees against him beckham was not yet 30 the minimum age to serve as governor at the time of his selection
goebel lost a close election to republican william s taylor when the general assembly s session opened on january 2 1900 the election results were immediately challenged with democrats in control of both houses of the assembly the results seemed sure to be reversed the assembly was still deliberating on january 30 1900 when goebel was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building the following day as goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel the general assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election he was sworn into office from his bed the same day three days later goebel died never having risen from the bed
legislative chaos ensued as taylor refused to acknowledge the assembly s decision and vacate the governorship the republicans in the legislature obeyed taylor s orders while the democrats ignored taylor and followed the orders of their leadership finally on february 21 1900 taylor and beckham agreed to let the courts settle the matter the case first went before the louisville circuit court which found in favor of beckham republicans appealed to the kentucky court of appeals at that time the court of last resort in the state on april 6 1900 the court of appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court taylor appealed to the supreme court of the united states which declined to hear the case on may 21 1900 taylor s only supporter on the court was kentuckian john marshall harlan
following the supreme court ruling taylor fled to indianapolis indiana fearing he would be implicated in goebel s assassination beckham became acting governor but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election a special election was held november 6 1900 to determine who would complete goebel s unexpired term beckham now of age won the election over republican john w yerkes by fewer than 4 000 votes shortly following the special election beckham married jean raphael fuqua of owensboro the couple had two sons
as governor beckham sought to unite his party and the state as part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan goebel election law authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the general assembly he stressed non controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state s educational system he recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices a reform both he and goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign however his passive leadership ensured that the general assembly did little to address his agenda the only major pieces of legislation passed during beckham s term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state s revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14 to work without their parents consent
second term
although the kentucky constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms beckham announced he would seek a full term as governor in 1903 his candidacy was challenged in court but the court ruled beckham had not served a full first term and was eligible to run due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non controversial reforms he had no significant opposition in winning his party s nomination his record also deprived his republican opponent morris b belknap of any significant campaign issue in the general election beckham defeated belknap and three minor candidates
in his message to the legislature in 1904 beckham again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law which had not passed during his first term the law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session during the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late governor goebel
in march 1904 beckham signed the day law mandating racial segregation of all schools in kentucky berea college a private college in eastern kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s immediately filed suit to challenge the law the substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the kentucky court of appeals berea appealed to the supreme court and in 1908 the court handed down an 8 1 decision against the college only john marshall harlan dissented
near the close of the 1904 session legislators approved the creation of beckham county from parts of carter elliott and lewis counties olive hill was made the county seat soon the county s existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the 400 square miles 1 000 km2 required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than 400 square miles 1 000 km2 carter county joined the lawsuit claiming the border of beckham county passed too close to grayson the seat of carter county and vanceburg the seat of lewis county the state constitution forbade county borders to pass within 10 miles 16 km of a county seat on april 29 1904 the kentucky court of appeals found in favor of the plaintiffs and dissolved beckham county
during the 1906 legislative session beckham urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies following the lead of new york attorney charles evans hughes in particular he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on hand for illegal purposes he further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in kentucky bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud
beckham refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing black patch tobacco wars he cited constitutional reasons for his refusal but more probably his reasons were political the democrats were dominant in this region and he didn t want to challenge his own party by collecting some old civil war debts from the federal government beckham virtually eliminated the state s debt encouraged by the state s improved finances the general assembly voted to expand two of the state s normal schools western state teachers college in bowling green later western kentucky university and eastern state teachers college in richmond later part of eastern kentucky university
with a successful legislative session behind him beckham made a bold political move in june 1906 he orchestrated an effort to set the democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in november a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election beckham wanted the senate seat and moving the primary up two years would allow him to secure his party s nomination while he was still governor it also allowed him to use his influence as governor to sway the party s choice of his potential successor as governor state auditor samuel wilbur hager was beckham s choice for governor and easily won the early primary over challenger n b hays former governor james b mccreary challenged beckham for the senatorial nomination but beckham won by more than 11 000 votes
u s senator
beckham s term as governor ended december 10 1907 in january 1908 he faced the legislature as the democratic nominee for a seat in the u s senate by virtue of the primary held two years earlier the republicans nominated former governor william o bradley on the first ballot beckham secured 66 of the needed 69 votes bradley received 64 votes seven democrats had not voted for beckham over the next six weeks 25 more votes were taken with neither man securing a majority even though william jennings bryan the democratic nominee for president campaigned for beckham some democrats pressured beckham to withdraw and allow a more palatable democrat to run but he refused on the 29th ballot taken near the end of february 1908 bradley finally secured a majority after four democrats crossed party lines to vote for him
beckham s ardent support of prohibition likely cost him the election his position put him at odds with henry watterson editor of the powerful louisville courier journal as governor beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in louisville when the kentucky court of appeals invalidated the results of louisville s municipal elections due to interference by the city s whiskey ring in may 1907 beckham appointed robert worth bingham a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist as interim mayor until elections could be held in november bingham eliminated grafting in the police department closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on sunday following this the whiskey ring announced beckham had forfeited the support of louisville s legislators in the senatorial election in 1908 three of the four democrats who voted against beckham were from louisville following his defeat beckham returned to his law practice
six years later beckham again attempted to win the senate seat due to the passage of the seventeenth amendment the senator would not be elected by the legislature but by popular vote in the democratic primary beckham defeated augustus o stanley a 12 year veteran congressman the republican nominee was former governor augustus e willson bolstered by his support of president woodrow wilson beckham won the election by 32 000 votes
beckham served as chairman of the senate committee on expenditures in the department of labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the senate committee on military affairs in the latter position he was influential in securing two large military training posts for kentucky camp zachary taylor and fort knox though camp zachary taylor was abandoned after world war i fort knox became the home of the united states bullion depository when the united states entered world war i beckham continued to back president wilson and supported the league of nations
true to his prohibitionist stance beckham supported passage of the eighteenth amendment forbidding the import and sale of alcohol in the united states the amendment was ratified and became effective in january 1920 believing women should be protected from involvement in politics beckham opposed the nineteenth amendment which granted women s suffrage the amendment failed on february 10 1919 but passed on june 4 1919 beckham voted against it both times
the democrats renominated beckham without opposition in 1920 his opponent in the general election was republican richard p ernst prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state and in areas where these industries were prominent beckham received more than 5 000 fewer votes than democratic presidential nominee james m cox he was also hurt by the women s vote and by his support of president wilson who had lost popularity since beckham s election in 1914 ernst won the election by fewer than 5 000 votes winning the race with 50 3 percent of the vote to beckham s 49 7 percent during his single term in the senate beckham served alongside three other u s senators from kentucky ollie m james george b martin and augustus o stanley
later life and death
following his term in the senate beckham resumed his legal practice in louisville he sought another term as governor in 1927 this time he had the support of the louisville courier journal which had been purchased by his ally robert w bingham he was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the jockey club whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state s horse racetracks
the jockey club ran a candidate in both parties primary elections in the democratic primary beckham defeated the club s relatively obscure candidate robert t crowe flem d sampson the club s nominee in the republican primary won his party s nomination in the general election beckham could not secure the support of democratic governor william j fields who had been elected with the help of the jockey club despite the democrats winning every other contest on the ballot including the race for lieutenant governor beckham lost to sampson by more than 32 000 votes it was estimated that the club spent over 500 000 to defeat him
beckham was expected to be the democrats nominee for governor in 1935 but the death of his son in late 1934 left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign the democrats turned to a b happy chandler of henderson who won the election beckham supported chandler s bid and in return chandler appointed him to the kentucky public service commission in 1936 beckham also served on the department of business regulations commission and chaired the state government reorganization commission
beckham attempted to return to the senate in 1936 the head of the jockey club james b brown had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930 in 1933 beckham s ally robert bingham had been appointed ambassador to the court of st james s increasing his prominence and influence beckham also enjoyed the support of the united mine workers and louisville mayor neville miller the race was complicated though by the entry of john y brown a democrat who was a u s representative and former speaker of the kentucky house of representatives he had agreed to support chandler s bid for the governorship in exchange for chandler s support in his run for the senate however chandler threw his support to beckham and while brown was not able to win the seat without the support of bingham and chandler he did garner 85 000 votes most of them at beckham s expense democratic incumbent m m logan retained the seat by 2 385 votes
beckham died in louisville on january 9 1940 and was buried in frankfort cemetery in frankfort kentucky beckham county oklahoma was named in his honor at the suggestion of a kentuckian who was serving as a delegate to oklahoma s constitutional convention in 1907 wickland his birthplace was added to the national register of historic places on february 16 1973
1888 89 new zealand native football team
the 1888 89 new zealand native football team was a new zealand rugby union team that toured britain ireland australia and new zealand in 1888 and 1889 it mostly comprised players of m ori ancestry and also included some p keh white new zealanders a wholly private endeavour the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority it was organised by new zealand international player joseph warbrick promoted by civil servant thomas eyton and managed by james scott a publican the natives were the first new zealand team to perform a haka and also the first to wear all black they played 107 rugby matches during the tour as well as a small number of victorian rules football and association football matches in australia having made a significant impact on the development of new zealand rugby the natives were inducted into the international rugby board hall of fame in 2008
after a preliminary tour of new zealand in 1888 the side travelled to england via melbourne and suez the m ori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race but the british press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as m ori as they had expected playing their first match on 3 october against surrey the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule and frequently played three matches per week their early matches included a 9 0 loss to middlesex but their form improved in november when they won 10 of their 13 matches the team played its first international match on 1 december against ireland and won 13 4 this was followed by a win over one of the strongest english county teams yorkshire and a 5 0 defeat against the wales national team by january 1889 the natives had played 36 matches in less than three months winning 22 of them they had spent most of their time in the north of england where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable
in a return match on 19 january yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the natives heaviest losses a 16 4 defeat the team then went undefeated until 16 february when they faced england officials of the strictly amateur rugby football union rfu had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the new zealanders regarding them as unsportsmanlike and tensions reached a nadir in the aftermath of the england international during which the rfu secretary george rowland hill refereeing the game awarded a number of controversial tries to england prompting three of the natives to temporarily leave the field in protest england eventually won 7 0 the natives apologised afterwards for their behaviour but the damage was not repaired the new zealanders left england without an official send off and travelled to australia where they toured victoria new south wales and queensland they then returned to new zealand where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before they went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match on 24 august 1889 7 2 to auckland
the natives final record in rugby matches was 78 wins 6 draws and 23 losses they introduced a number of tactical innovations to new zealand rugby on their return home and their tour contributed to the formation of the new zealand rugby football union in 1892 seventeen of the team s 26 players went on to play provincially in new zealand and two thomas ellison and david gage subsequently captained the new zealand national rugby team
background
the idea for assembling a team of m ori footballers to tour britain was conceived by joseph warbrick a rugby player who had toured with the first new zealand national team in 1884 he initially proposed a team of m ori or part m ori to play the touring british side in 1888 this developed into a venture to have a m ori team tour britain if a preliminary tour of new zealand were successful hearing of warbrick s plans civil servant thomas eyton contacted him to offer help managing the tour which warbrick accepted when james scott a publican subsequently joined the partnership the three men decided that warbrick would be the team s captain scott its manager and eyton its promoter
warbrick started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888 he had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability and failed to secure the talented jack taiaroa due to his university commitments some m ori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part m ori twenty m ori or part m ori players joined the squad five p keh white new zealand players were added after the team lost to auckland due to the inclusion of these p keh players the team was renamed from the new zealand maori to the new zealand native football representatives the final squad comprised 26 players including warbrick of these at least five were full blooded m ori while fourteen had a m ori mother and a p keh father the parentage of some of the players is unknown
the team toured new zealand before departing overseas playing against hawke s bay auckland nelson wellington canterbury south canterbury and otago the first game was contested against hawke s bay in napier on 23 june 1888 they played nine games in their preliminary tour of new zealand and won seven of them their last new zealand match before departure against otago played in dunedin on 31 july 1888 was won by one try to nil
the team sailed for australia from dunedin leaving on 1 august 1888 in melbourne scott recruited jack lawlor to train the players in victorian rules football in britain as preparation for possible victorian rules matches on their return to australia the team played two rugby matches against the melbourne rugby union team winning the first and drawing the second before continuing to britain via suez they arrived in london on 27 september 1888
arrival in england and early matches
the team were met in britain by local rugby administrators including an official of england s rugby football union rfu the first match of the tour was against surrey where the team became the first new zealand side to perform a haka and also the first to wear an all black uniform that the team was predominantly m ori provoked curiosity from the british press at the time most britons had not seen non white people but there was some surprise that the team were not as m ori as had been expected they are not unlike europeans a scottish reporter wrote in november 1888 that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation the surrey match which was refereed by the rfu secretary george rowland hill was won 4 1 by the natives after they scored two tries
the natives next defeated both northamptonshire and kent before defeats by moseley and burton on trent both defeats were unexpected and in the moseley match injuries played a part the tourists played most of the match at least two men down as replacements were then not allowed the team recovered to win their next game against midlands counties in birmingham their next fixture was against middlesex in a match not open to the public and hosted by the earl of sheffield at sheffield park uckfield the middlesex side contained a number of international players including arthur gould middlesex won easily with the natives play characterised by poor tackling the final score was 9 0 with three tries conceded by the new zealanders prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine an indulgence the natives were not used to a report in the auckland star had this to say of the game
the new zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition 15 of scratch players whereas mr rowland hill had carefully collected the best possible team available such passing as the home men displayed the maoris frankly admit they have never previously witnessed said mccausland whilst we were on the platform waiting for the london train i think they would have just beaten us even if we had been in good form
following the match against middlesex the team travelled to the north where the strongest english rugby teams were based yorkshire and lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the rfu in 1895 over the issue of broken time payments the new zealanders lost to hull 1 0 defeated dewsbury then lost to wakefield after their first draw of the tour against northumberland county they defeated stockton on tees and tynemouth joe warbrick appeared in the match against tynemouth but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point these victories were followed by a 13 4 defeat to halifax on 10 november the team then won seven matches in a row including one against hawick rfc their only scottish opposition of the tour the last two matches that month were a loss to swinton and a 9 0 victory over liverpool and district the team had played thirteen fixtures during november and won ten of them by this point the team was beset by injuries of the fifteen players that played against westmorland county on 24 november five had injuries the squad comprised only 26 players and the tourists were often struggling to field a side nevertheless their heavy schedule continued on 30 november 1888 they left for dublin where a match had been organised against the ireland national team
ireland further english matches and wales
the ireland fixture was played at lansdowne road dublin on 1 december 1888 both teams had a number of leading players out injured the irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection ireland led 3 0 at half time after scoring a converted try but the natives improved considerably in the second half scoring four tries patrick keogh scored the first two tries and his play was praised by the local press the third try scored was by thomas ellison after a counter attack by george williams the try was not converted but the strong finish from the new zealanders gave the visitors a 13 4 victory the irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team but ireland did go on to defeat wales two tries to nil in the 1889 home nations championship following their defeat of ireland the natives played trinity college and then north of ireland the match against trinity college was drawn 4 4 and despite keogh not playing the native side played much better than their previous fixture the team then travelled to belfast where they defeated north of ireland 2 0 on 5 december scoring two tries to nil
after returning to england the natives faced lancashire in manchester where they lost 1 0 two days later they drew with batley bulldogs despite their opposition scoring five tries their next match was against yorkshire who were one of the strongest counties in the country and went on to win the inaugural county championship that season yorkshire fielded a weakened team and were subsequently defeated 10 6 by the natives who scored six tries after a further two victories the team travelled to wales where they lost 3 0 to llanelli before facing wales on 22 december
at the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the welsh team due to fans of both swansea and llanelli feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players four teams dominated welsh international selection at the time and out of the 15 man team only william towers and william bowen of swansea and dan griffiths of llanelli had been selected the match was played in swansea and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd with gate receipts of only 120 recorded the crowd s hostility impacted on the players and debutant norman biggs was palpably nervous at the start of the match biggs aged 18 years and 49 days became the youngest welsh international player a record he held until the debut of tom prydie in 2010 despite the heckles aimed primarily at biggs charlie arthur and george thomas the welsh team produced an excellent effort especially from the forwards
towers scored the first welsh try which was converted by jim webb the natives replied with a spirited run by ellison but he failed to break through the welsh defence the tourists trailed even further after george thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half way line which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd webb playing in out of position at full back missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark the natives continued to push with elliot coming within five yards of the try line and when ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25 yard line before he could touch down in the second half wales continued to push their advantage when alexander bland dribbled the ball into the natives 25 this was collected by sydney nicholls who managed to get the ball across the try line allowing jim hannan to score warbrick for the natives and stadden for wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries but there were no further scores in the game
the match was also of historical importance because of the welsh tactics employed in the 1886 home nations championship wales had trialled the four three quarter system wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine and instead employ an extra centre three quarter the system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star welsh player arthur gould whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team newport to retain the additional forward with gould working in the west indies wales again tried the four three quarter system against the natives and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system within six years the other three home countries had adopted four three quarter style of play
before they left wales the natives played swansea and two other local clubs newport and cardiff they defeated swansea for their first win in wales and followed this up with a victory over newport in front of 8 000 spectators they finished their welsh matches and the year with a 4 1 loss to cardiff in front of a partisan crowd
return to england
the side entered 1889 having played 36 matches for 22 wins and three draws the natives play had improved throughout november and december following poorer form in their october matches positive press reports reflected this improvement the team would go on to play a further 17 matches before their 16 february international against england january started with a 4 1 loss to bradford during which 25 police officers were required to keep many of the 12 000 spectators many of them non paying in order this was followed by victories over leeds parish church kirkstall brighouse rangers and huddersfield following further matches against stockport castleford and warrington where the team drew lost then won the side faced yorkshire for a second time
yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line up against the natives when the sides first met in december after the unexpected loss yorkshire were determined to make amends and a strong side was selected for the county including fred bonsor richard lockwood and john willie sutcliffe all of whom would appear for england against the natives later that season described as knocked about and stale the natives struggled to compete against such strong opposition and yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to ellison left the scores at 9 1 at half time the second half was little better for the natives they conceded a further two tries as well as a drop goal the second of these tries was scored by lockwood after he ran the ball from his own half ellison scored a converted try late in the match but this didn t prevent the natives suffering their largest defeat of the tour 16 4 to the yorkshiremen ellison later described the match as without a murmur the biggest beating we received in our whole tour
after a victory over spen valley district the team travelled west to play somersetshire devonshire taunton and gloucestershire and won all five games the victory over somerset was the new zealanders largest of the tour they scored nine tries in a 17 4 victory half back keogh played outstandingly for the natives while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition devonshire and tauton suffered heavy defeats by the new zealanders before a strong gloucestershire side was dismissed after defeating midland counties the natives returned to london
the team had two further matches before their international against england the first was against one of the strongest clubs in england blackheath andrew stoddart who had toured new zealand and australia with the 1888 british isles side played for the club in their 9 3 defeat to the natives the new zealanders won having scored four tries including two by keogh their next opposition was a united services side mainly comprising royal navy players the natives were again victorious this time 10 0 the match against oxford university was postponed due to heavy frost and so the team had a seven day break from playing their longest of the tour

the match against england was causing the natives players and management problems before it had even begun the team manager scott was in dispute with the rfu over where the match should be played the rfu were adamant that the match should take place at blackheath s ground but scott wanted the game to proceed at the oval where a larger crowd and therefore higher gate receipts could be secured the strictly amateur rfu establishment were already suspicious of the profit making motives of the natives and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue the rfu was also in dispute with the other home unions over the formation of the international rugby football board irfb following a disputed try in an england scotland international match in 1888 the scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game but the rfu insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote arguing that they deserved this as they were they asserted the senior body and had the most member clubs ireland wales and scotland consequently refused to play against england until 1891 when following arbitration the rfu relented and joined the irfb the absence of international matches was a factor in england agreeing to face the natives on 16 february 1889
the line ups selected for the 16 february match were both strong and close to full strength though 12 of the england side had not played internationally before all were experienced at domestic level the match was refereed by rowland hill who had also officiated the natives first match in britain against surrey the opening of the first half was a scoreless affair with much tackling and scrummaging on the heavy ground later in the half england scored two tries through harry bedford but both were disputed by the natives who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in goal england took the two try advantage into the second half
early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the english the try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the natives and the rfu ellison attempted to tackle the english player stoddart and in the process ripped his shorts off the natives quickly formed a circle around stoddart to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen while this was happening one of the english players frank evershed picked up the ball and scored a try the new zealanders protested believing that play had stopped after claiming stoddart had called dead ball but hill awarded the try prompting three of the native players dick taiaroa williams and sherry wynyard to leave the field in protest the aggrieved players were eventually persuaded to return but not before hill had restarted play ellison was very critical of hill particularly because he was also secretary of the rfu ellison wrote after the tour that gross as these errors were they were insignificant when compared with another that mr hill committed at the outset of the game viz refereeing at all in that game the disputed try was followed by a final try for the english who ultimately won 7 0
the rfu at hill s instigation promptly demanded an apology from the natives captain of the day edward mccausland who had led the team as joe warbrick was injured the english authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question and that protesting a decision as the new zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike the rfu threatened to bar any of their affiliated players in other words the entire rugby playing population of england from facing the natives if they did not apologise mccausland swiftly sent an apology by telegram but this was deemed inadequate he therefore sent another four days after the game
the london establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the new zealanders approach to the game reports of rough and over aggressive play by the natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in britain in the north of england criticism of the visitors sportsmanship was rarer the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south some of the natives including joe warbrick accused the rfu and the english press of hypocrisy claiming that they were quick to criticise the new zealanders for rough play yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players
later matches and departure from england
the natives remained in london following the england international they defeated london welsh on 18 february before losing first to cambridge then oxford university from there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to leigh after a win over runcorn there was a defeat to oldham played on a ground eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous after reversing their previous loss to halifax with a 6 0 win the natives suffered a loss to barrow and district on 7 march the new zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1 1 draw with hull widnes were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists last match in northern england
the team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in britain they eventually played southern counties and beat them 3 1 this was their 74th match in the british isles and their 49th victory the authorities and press in london continued to view the team negatively and the natives boarded ship without a formal farewell this perceived affront from the rfu provoked some criticism from the press outside london as well as from the team manager scott who felt that with the team s official apology after the england match the controversy should have put to rest
australia
the majority of the natives left plymouth on 29 march eyton and pie wynyard followed a week later they arrived in melbourne in may where the team played mostly victorian rules football hoping to make more money that way although the side had employed jack lawlor to coach them in victorian rules during their tour of the british isles the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training as a result the victorian rules matches were a failure the players unfamiliarity with the rules combined with the fact that most of the natives were rugby forwards and therefore less suited to the more open victorian rules ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds the side played nine victorian rules matches in total including one in new south wales but won only three of them all against relatively weak opposition
the side s success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in victorian rules the new zealanders played three rugby matches while in victoria against melbourne a navy selection and victoria the matches were all won with their game against victoria a 19 0 victory after this they left for sydney for further rugby matches and defeated new south wales 12 9 after two further victories the side again faced new south wales and won the match 16 12 another two victories followed before the team played their only association football matches of the tour both defeats
the team travelled north to queensland where as in new south wales rugby was the dominant code of football consequently the team exclusively played rugby while in the region the natives faced queensland at the association ground in brisbane the 8000 spectators witnessed the new zealanders overwhelm the queenslanders to win 22 0 the natives did not exert themselves in the win and the score did not reflect their dominance after a further two matches against toowoomba and ipswich both of whom were comfortably defeated the team returned to brisbane for a rematch with queensland in contrast to their first meeting the first half was a close affair and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half billy warbrick suffered a kick to the head and had to retire early in the second half following the loss of warbrick the play of the natives improved and they recovered to win 11 7 not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered 50 by bookmakers to throw the game eyton later said
it was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought in racing parlance to be playing stiff and that they had been got by some bookies at all events when accused of it at half time and cautioned they played a different game in the second half
the response from the team s management was to suspend four players the team travelled to toowoomba where they defeated the locals 19 0 the natives included a replacement player for only the second time charles speakman after the suspensions reduced the playing strength of the side the team then travelled back to new zealand and arrived in invercargill on 5 august
return to new zealand
two days after their return the natives faced southland who they defeated 5 1 in front of a crowd of 2 000 the side suffered further injury to harry lee and recruited southlander w hirst for their match against mataura district on 8 august despite playing the match two players down the natives comfortably defeated mataura 16 3 following the side s return to new zealand the otago rugby football union demanded that the team s management explain the accusations levelled at them in queensland eyton responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred the northern rugby union since renamed queensland rugby union summarised the incident and aftermath in the 1889 queensland rugby union annual
it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the maori as they were not showing their usual dash and combination four members of the team were suspended a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match the matter was bought before the otago union who passed the following resolution that having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the native team and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management we are of opinion that there are no facts before us justifying the allegations
it is unlikely given the attitude of the otago rugby union to the natives before their departure that they would have dismissed the allegations if incriminating evidence had existed the side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced otago in dunedin the natives outscored their opponents five tries to two and won 11 8 the side s star player and half back keogh stayed in dunedin when the team departed for christchurch the side faced hawke s bay who were touring in christchurch and handily defeated them 13 2 the natives play was praised by the press the wearers of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and quickness between their legs over their shoulders under their arms and with their feet the side then faced canterbury on 17 august who they thrashed 15 0 the report published in the press said of the natives performance
the play showed on saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men in the loose in the scrum dribbling passing collaring or running they were very much indeed canterbury s superior such runs as were made by warbrick at full back by madigan gage and w wynyard the passing of h wynyard f warbrick and all the backs as well as several forwards the rushes of alf warbrick maynard taare taiaroa and rene and the dodging and fending powers of nearly every one nonplussed their opponents
the side left christchurch and travelled north where they played wairarapa in masterton the match was won 10 8 and the next day they faced wellington who they also defeated the fixture against wellington was nearly abandoned because scott and the wellington rugby union could not agree on a venue the match went ahead only when the wellington officials agreed to cede the natives all profit from the match after this the natives travelled to auckland where they played their last match against the province on 24 august the match was lost 7 2 after each team scored two tries each but the aucklanders kicked a drop goal and a conversion the loss ended a remarkable run of matches the natives had a 31 game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over widnes on 9 march the side won 30 and drew one match between the defeats
impact and legacy
the tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within new zealand it was the first tour of the british isles by a team from the southern hemisphere and the longest in the history of the sport by the time the natives returned to new zealand they had developed into a side superior to any in the country and introduced a number of tactical innovations seventeen of the 26 players went on to play provincially in new zealand and two ellison and david gage subsequently captained new zealand
the tour also prompted the eventual formation of the new zealand rugby football union nzrfu later renamed new zealand rugby union in 1892 one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring new zealand sides the nzrfu sent an officially sanctioned new zealand team captained by ellison to tour australia in 1893 the natives are also the forefathers of the m ori all blacks a representative team organised by the nzrfu that first played in 1910 the native team along with joe warbrick was inducted into the irb hall of fame in 2008 the seventh inductee
squad
the squad consisted of 26 players the exact names of several of the players is unknown the number of matches played is a minimum number only the line ups for a number of matches in britain and australia are either incomplete or unknown

va gauthier
va gauthier september 20 1885 december 20 1958 was a canadian american mezzo soprano and voice teacher she performed and popularised songs by contemporary composers throughout her career and sang in the american premieres of several works by erik satie maurice ravel and igor stravinsky including the title role in the latter s pers phone
the niece of lady laurier and sir wilfrid laurier who also were her patrons she initially trained and performed in europe she then travelled to java and for four years immersed herself in its native music which she introduced to north american audiences on her return she retired from performing in 1937 and opened a voice studio in new york where she became a founding member of the american guild of musical artists and served on its board of governors gauthier was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music the citation from the campion society of san francisco which she received in 1949 said her rare open mindedness and unorthodox enthusiasm having been initially responsible for the recognition of many vital and important modern composers
singing career
born in ottawa ontario gauthier received musical lessons as a child in harmony voice and piano the custom of the time dictated that north american musicians travel to europe for training if they desired a reputable professional career and in july 1902 at the age of seventeen gauthier set out for europe financed by her aunt and uncle lady zo laurier and sir wilfrid laurier
training in europe
gauthier travelled to france where she received private voice lessons from auguste jean dubulle of the paris conservatory nodules on her vocal cords were problematic but they were removed surgically she later began training under jacques bouhy whom she would later credit for her vocal technique in 1906 gauthier was retained by fellow canadian singer emma albani to accompany her on a tour of england and her canadian farewell tour albani provided a degree of mentorship to gauthier during the 30 week tour of canada
lord strathcona awarded gauthier a scholarship in 1906 that allowed her to return to europe and continue her vocal studies she returned there and continued both to study and give performances her first operatic performance came in 1909 in pavia italy as mica la in bizet s carmen she landed a second operatic role as mallika in delibes lakm which was being performed by the london covent garden opera company the opera opened in june 1910 supposedly luisa tetrazzini the prima donna soprano of the company feared that gauthier s voice would outshine her own and demanded that gauthier be removed from the opera the company s director acquiesced to tetrazzini s demands informing gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing gauthier reacted badly and quit opera entirely
move to java
disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene gauthier departed europe and travelled to java there she met a dutch importer and plantation manager named frans knoote gauthier and knoote married on may 22 1911 gauthier studied the music of java and began to include this in her repertoire her accompanying pianist was paul seelig who had previously been the conductor for the kraton of surakarta which afforded gauthier a number of opportunities on permission of the javanese court she studied the gamelan probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity while living in java gauthier travelled extensively giving performances in china japan singapore malaya australia and new zealand she remained in java for four years but with the outbreak of world war i she decided to travel back to north america arriving in new york city in the fall of 1915
return to north america
arriving in new york gauthier struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene she put on a performance in vaudeville entitled songmotion which combined javan music with dancers new york was already home to many north american and european musical performers so gauthier focused on her javan musical repertoire which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing gauthier began giving annual recitals at aeolian hall and in november 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers she developed her own reputation quickly known as a sensitive purveyor of interesting untried songs she gave renditions of three songs by maurice ravel her performance then also included american premieres of stravinsky s three japanese lyrics and griffes five poems of ancient china and japan the performance was a great success and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers stravinsky arranged to have gauthier to premiere all of his vocal pieces
gauthier travelled to paris in 1920 at the behest of the music league of america sent there to arrange a tour of north america by maurice ravel she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him but also with erik satie and les six this led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert she accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her the only exception being a refusal to perform pierrot lunaire by arnold schoenberg through this gauthier performed large amounts of contemporary french music across the united states she also included american music in all of her concerts gauthier toured america frequently and returned to europe in 1922 and again in 1923 she began to explore jazz music in concert as well earning her negative reviews by many musical critics
her 1923 annual performance at aeolian hall entitled recital of ancient and modern music for voice became a historic occasion when she presented the works of george gershwin the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert the first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time she performed both classical works by vincenzo bellini and henry purcell mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by arnold schoenberg darius milhaud b la bart k and paul hindemith the second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment however she opened with alexander s ragtime band by irving berlin then performed works by jerome kern and walter donaldson and finally finished with three works by george gershwin i ll build a stairway to paradise innocent ing nue baby and swanee gershwin played the piano for these pieces important figures in the audience included ernestine schumann heink virgil thomson and paul whiteman although some musical critics panned her decision to include jazz music the performance was overall a huge success and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art
gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences on some occasions such as her performances of gershwin in new york in 1923 and 1925 as well as in london in 1925 this was quite successful a critic in vienna welcomed her musical selection as a reprieve from the usual fare of classical performances schubert brahms wolf richard strauss while praising her skill with more classical choices other performances suffered she was booed while performing works by heitor villa lobos at the festival of the international society of contemporary music in venice she became a celebrity and continued giving performances across the united states europe and her native canada on the sixtieth anniversary of canadian confederation in 1927 she gave a performance in ottawa which was the first transcontinental radio broadcast in canada although she toured canada from time to time and attended performances of canadian music in new york she held a negative opinion of canada s treatment of native musicians saying canadians would rather listen to foreigners than their own people
retirement from the stage
illness forced gauthier to halt giving performances in the late 1920s but she would return to the stage in 1931 giving a concert in havana cuba as time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching and less and less in stage performing her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring she retired from performing entirely in 1937 and opened a music studio in new york there she became a founding member of the american guild of musical artists serving on its board of governors she died on december 20 1958
views of critics and audiences
gauthier was a controversial musician in her time her choice of music for performance was often condemned and often praised the appropriateness of jazz music for a classically trained singer combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some critics to cheer her for promoting otherwise overlooked music and others to condemn her for taking lowbrow music into a highbrow venue
a may 1 1917 review by the new york times praised her natural talent with some reservations about the unpolished quality of her voice her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised her singing of songs by frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them
a november 12 1923 time review of her performance of historic italian songs as well as modern english french austrian german and american numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music the critic remarked her voice was much too good for jazz here she was praised as a serious scholarly artist whose performance was neat and expressive the audience received the concert very enthusiastically
her performance in fargo in 1923 resulted in a headline in the fargo forum the next day that was headed eva gauthier s program sets whole town buzzing many people are of two minds regarding jazz numbers some reluctantly admit that they like them others keep silent or condemn them the review divides the audience and critics into various camps those who openly enjoyed and applauded the performance those who openly disliked and condemned it those unsure how to react to a performance they liked but felt was inappropriate and those who liked the performance but would not show approval for fear of looking foolish or uncultured

battle of sullivan s island
the battle of sullivan s island or the battle of fort sullivan was fought on june 28 1776 during the american revolutionary war it took place near charleston south carolina during the first british attempt to capture the city from american rebels it is also sometimes referred to as the first siege of charleston owing to a more successful british siege in 1780
the british organized an expedition in early 1776 for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of north america delayed by logistical concerns and bad weather the expedition reached the coast of north carolina in may 1776 finding conditions unsuitable for their operations general henry clinton and admiral sir peter parker decided instead to act against charleston arriving there in early june troops were landed on long island near sullivan s island where colonel william moultrie commanded a partially constructed fort in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault general charles lee commanding the southern continental theater of the war would provide supervision
the land assault was frustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to wade and the american defenses prevented an amphibious landing the naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the spongy nature of the fort s palmetto log construction careful fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the british fleet which withdrew after an entire day s bombardment the british withdrew their expedition force to new york and did not return to south carolina until 1780
background
when the american revolutionary war broke out in 1775 the city of charleston in the colony of south carolina was a center of commerce in southern north america the city s citizens joined other colonists in opposing the british parliament s attempts to tax them and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the april 1775 battles of lexington and concord throughout 1775 and into 1776 militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony s backcountry the city s manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city
british operations
british army forces in north america were primarily tied up with the siege of boston in 1775 seeking bases of operations where they had more control the british planned an expedition to the southern colonies major general henry clinton then in boston was to travel to cape fear north carolina where he would join with largely scottish loyalists raised in the north carolina backcountry and a force of 2 000 men from ireland under the command of major general charles cornwallis
the plan was beset by difficulties from the start the irish expedition originally supposed to depart at the beginning of december 1775 was delayed by logistical difficulties and its 2 500 troops did not depart until february 13 1776 escorted by 11 warships under the command of admiral sir peter parker clinton left boston on january 20 with two companies of light infantry and first stopped at new york city to confer with william tryon new york s royal governor major general charles lee sent by major general george washington to see to the defense of new york coincidentally arrived there the same day as clinton new york was at that time extremely tense patriot forces were beginning to disarm and evict loyalists and the british fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions despite this clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south lee observed that this was certainly a droll way of proceeding to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited this was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists a letter intercepted in december had already provided intelligence that the british were planning to go to the south
clinton arrived at cape fear on march 12 expecting to find the european convoy already there he met with the royal governors of north and south carolina josiah martin and william campbell and learned that the recruited scottish loyalists had been defeated at moore s creek bridge two weeks earlier clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of georgia james wright who had been arrested and then escaped to a navy ship
parker s fleet had an extremely difficult crossing battered by storms and high seas the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at cape fear until april 18 and cornwallis did not arrive until may 3 after several weeks there in which the british troops raided patriot properties clinton cornwallis and parker concluded that cape fear was not a suitable base for further operations parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions up and down the coast and reports on the partially finished condition of the charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there
american defenses
john rutledge recently elected president of the general assembly that remained as the backbone of south carolina s revolutionary government organized a defense force under the command of 46 year old colonel william moultrie a former militiaman and indian fighter these forces comprised three infantry regiments two rifle regiments and a small artillery regiment they were augmented by three independent artillery companies and the total force numbered about 2 000 these forces were further augmented by the arrival of continental regiments from north carolina and virginia 1 900 troops as well as militia numbering 2 700 from charleston and the surrounding backcountry
moultrie saw sullivan s island a sandy spit of land at the entrance to charleston harbor extending north about 4 miles 6 4 km long and a few hundred yards wide as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from intruding enemy warships a large vessel sailing into charleston first had to cross charleston bar a series of submerged shoals lying about 8 miles 13 km southeast of the city and then pass by the southern end of sullivan s island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor later it would also have to pass the northern end of james island where fort johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city moultrie and his 2nd south carolina regiment arrived on sullivan s island in march 1776 and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into charleston harbor the construction moved slowly captain peter horry of the patriot naval detachment described the site as an immense pen 500 feet long and 16 feet wide filled with sand to stop the shot the gun platforms were made of planks two inches thick and fastened with wooden spikes
congress had appointed general lee to command the continental army troops in the southern colonies and his movements by land shadowed those of clinton s fleet as it sailed south lee wrote from wilmington on june 1 that the fleet had sailed but that he did not know whether it was sailing for virginia or south carolina he headed for charleston saying i confess i know not whether i shall go to or from the enemy he arrived in charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor and took command of the city s defenses he immediately ran into a problem the south carolina troops militia or the colonial regiments were not on the continental line and thus not formally under his authority some south carolina troops resisted his instructions and rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming lee in command of all south carolina forces
square shaped fort sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall with walls made from palmetto logs 20 feet 6 1 m high and 16 feet 4 9 m wide the walls were filled with sand and rose 10 feet 3 0 m above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted a hastily erected palisade of thick planks helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls an assortment of 31 cannon ranging from 9 and 12 pounders to a few british 18 pounders and french 26 pounders dotted the front and rear walls general lee when he had seen its unfinished state had recommended abandoning the fort calling it a slaughter pen president rutledge refused and specifically ordered colonel moultrie to obey lee in everything except in leaving fort sullivan moultrie s delaying tactics so angered lee that he decided on june 27 that he would replace moultrie the battle began the next day before he could do so lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to haddrell s point
british arrival
the british fleet weighed anchor at cape fear on may 31 and arrived outside charleston harbor the next day moultrie noticed a british scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby long island now known as the isle of palms just a few hundred yards from sullivan s island troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of sullivan s by june 8 most of the british fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in five fathom hole an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance with the fort on sullivan s island only half complete admiral parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls optimistically believing he would not even need clinton s land forces he wrote to clinton that after the fort s guns were knocked out he would land seamen and marines which i have practiced for the purpose under the guns and that they could keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper
the british fleet was composed of nine man of war ships the flagship 50 gun bristol as well as the 50 gun experiment and frigates actaeon active solebay siren sphinx friendship and the bomb vessel thunder in total mounting nearly 300 cannon the army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th 28th 33rd 37th 54th and 57th regiments of foot and part of the 46th on june 7 clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms however the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it which was flying a truce flag and it was not delivered until the next day that same day clinton began landing 2 200 troops on long island the intent was that these troops would wade across the channel now known as breach inlet between long and sullivan s which the british believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so while the fleet bombarded fort sullivan
general lee responded to the british landing with several actions he began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the british were intending to launch an attack directly on charleston he also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort s garrison but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile 1 6 km channel separating the island from charleston the unwillingness of moultrie and rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role the americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of sullivan s island which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons and began to fortify a guard post at haddrell s point on the mainland opposite fort sullivan
general clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on june 17 an attempt to wade the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder deep too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition he considered using boats to ferry the troops across but the americans with timely advice from general lee adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the long island position as a result the british and american forces faced each other across the channel engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range clinton reported that this meant that admiral parker would have the glory of being defeated alone the attack was originally planned for june 24 but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted parker to call it off for several days
battle
on the morning of june 28 fort sullivan was defended by colonel moultrie commanding the 2nd south carolina regiment and a company of the 4th south carolina artillery numbering 435 men at around 9 00 am that morning a british ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack less than an hour later nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort thunder and friendship anchored about 1 5 miles 2 4 km from the fort while parker took active bristol experiment and solebay to a closer position about 400 yards 370 m from sullivan s island where they anchored facing broadside to the fort each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position and the defenders returned the fire although many of thunder s shots landed in or near the fort they had little effect according to moultrie we had a morass in the middle that swallowed them up instantly and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort were immediately buried thunder s role in the action was also relatively short lived she had anchored too far away from the fort and the overloading of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts owing to shortage of gunpowder moultrie s men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons they also fired in small volleys four cannon at a time one british observer wrote their fire was surprisingly well served and it was slow but decisive indeed they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed
general clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of sullivan s island assisted by two sloops of war the flotilla of longboats carrying his troops came under fire from colonel william thomson s defenses facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire clinton abandoned the attempt
around noon the frigates sphinx syren and actaeon were sent on a roundabout route avoiding some shoals to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort s main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort however all three ships grounded on an uncharted sandbar and the riggings of actaeon and sphinx became entangled in the process the british managed to refloat sphinx and syren but acteon remained grounded having moved too far onto the submerged sandbar consequently none of these ships reached its intended position a piece of good fortune not lost on colonel moultrie had these three ships effected their purpose they would have enfiladed us in such a manner as to have driven us from our guns
at the fort moultrie ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man of war ships bristol and experiment which took hit after hit from the fort s guns chain shot fired at bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main and mizzenmasts one round hit her quarterdeck slightly wounding parker in the knee and thigh the shot also tore off part of his britches leaving his backside exposed by mid afternoon the defenders were running out of gunpowder and their fire was briefly suspended however lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland and the defenders resumed firing at the british ships lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day telling colonel moultrie i see you are doing very well here you have no occasion for me i will go up to the town again admiral parker eventually sought to destroy the fort s walls with persistent broadside cannonades this strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions the structure would quiver and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering the exchange continued until around 9 00 pm when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities and the fleet finally withdrew out of range
at one point during the battle the flag moultrie had designed and raised over the fort was shot down sergeant william jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided he was credited by moultrie with reviving the troops spirits and later given commendations for bravery a painting of this event pictured above depicts jasper s actions
counting casualties parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard bristol which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull yards and rigging experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded active and solebay reported 15 casualties each the americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded the following morning the british unable to drag the grounded acteon off the sandbar set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ship fired some of its cannons at the british ships took what stores and loot they could and retreated shortly before the ship s powder magazine exploded
aftermath
the british did not attempt to take the fort again within days of the battle charlestonians learned of the signing of the declaration of independence in philadelphia the british troops were reembarked on their transports and on july 21 the british fleet withdrew northward to help the main british army in its campaign against new york city to add insult to injury one of the british transports grounded off long island and was captured by patriot forces
the british did not return to charleston until 1780 when general clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army until the south again became a focus of the war in late 1778 its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort
admiral parker and general clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition s failures although clinton was not blamed by the government popular opinion held him responsible and parker was lauded for his personal bravery
legacy
fort sullivan was renamed fort moultrie shortly after the battle to honor colonel william moultrie for his successful defense of the fort and the city of charleston extensively modified in the years after the battle it was supplanted by fort sumter as the principal defense of charleston prior to the outbreak of the american civil war in 1876 to celebrate the centennial companies from savannah augusta macon columbia new york and boston were invited to charleston the site was turned over to the national park service in 1960 and is now part of fort sumter national monument
a small monument to the battle of sullivan s island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island overlooking the inlet where general clinton s soldiers had hoped to cross the monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement
one iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by colonel moultrie commissioned by the colonial government he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner which was flown at the fort during the battle despite being shot down during the siege it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense and famously raised during victory it came to be known as the moultrie flag or liberty flag when charleston lost to the british in the 1780 siege was reclaimed by american forces at the end of the war the flag was returned to the city by general nathanael greene
hu zhengyan
hu zhengyan chinese c 1584 1674 was a chinese artist printmaker and publisher he worked in calligraphy traditional chinese painting and seal carving but was primarily a publisher producing academic texts as well as records of his own work
hu lived in nanjing during the transition from the ming dynasty to the qing dynasty a ming loyalist he was offered a position at the rump court of the hongguang emperor but declined the post and never held anything more than minor political office he did however design the hongguang emperor s personal seal and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor s capture and death in 1645 he owned and operated an academic publishing house called the ten bamboo studio in which he practised various multi colour printing and embossing techniques and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise hu s work at the ten bamboo studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form
hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled the ten bamboo studio manual of painting and calligraphy an artist s primer which remained in print for around 200 years his studio also published seal catalogues academic and medical texts books on poetry and decorative writing papers many of these were edited and prefaced by hu and his brothers
biography
hu was born in xiuning county anhui province in 1584 or early 1585 both his father and elder brother zhengxin art name wusuo were physicians and after he turned 30 he travelled with them while they practised medicine in the areas around lu an and huoshan it is commonly stated that zhengyan himself was also a doctor though the earliest sources attesting to this occur only in the second half of the 19th century
by 1619 hu had moved to nanjing where he lived with his wife wu their home on jilongshan now also known as beiji ge a hill located just within the northern city wall served as a meeting house for like minded artists hu named it the ten bamboo studio shizhuzhai after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property it functioned as the headquarters for his printing business where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers zhengxin and zhengxing art name zizhu and his sons qipu and qiyi courtesy name
during hu s lifetime the ming dynasty which had ruled china for over 250 years was overthrown and replaced by china s last imperial dynasty the qing following the fall of the capital beijing in 1644 remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a ming loyalist regime in nanjing with zhu yousong on the throne as the hongguang emperor hu who was noted for his seal carving and facility with seal script created a seal for the new emperor the court offered him the position of drafter for the secretariat zhongshu sheren as a reward but he did not accept the role although he did accord himself the title of zhongshu sheren in some of his subsequent personal seals
according to wen ruilin s lost history of the south nanjiang yishi prior to the qing invasion of nanjing hu studied at the national university there and whilst a student was employed by the ministry of rites to record official proclamations he produced the imperial promotion of minor learning qin ban xiaoxue and the record of displayed loyalty biaozhong ji as part of this work as a result he was promoted to the ministry of personnel and gained admittance to the hanlin academy but before he could take up this appointment beijing had fallen to the manchu rebellion since contemporaneous biographies wen s work was not published until 1830 make no mention of these events it has been suggested that they were fabricated after hu s death
hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in 1646 after the end of the ming dynasty xiao yuncong and l liuliang recorded visiting him during his later years in 1667 and 1673 respectively he died in poverty at the age of 90 sometime around late 1673 or early 1674
seal carving
hu zhengyan was a noted seal carver producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries his style was rooted in the classical seal script of the han dynasty and he followed the huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary he zhen hu s calligraphy although balanced and with a clear compositional structure is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient weathered impression although unlike other huizhou artists hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals
hu s work was known outside his local area zhou lianggong a poet who lived in nanjing around the same time as hu and was a noted art connoisseur stated in his biography of seal carvers yinren zhuan that hu creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through nanjing
in 1644 hu took it upon himself to create a new imperial seal for the hongguang emperor which he carved after a period of fasting and prayer he presented his creation with an essay the great exhortation of the seal dabao zhen in which he bemoaned the loss of the chongzhen emperor s seal and begged heaven s favour in restoring it hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming equally footed couplets pianti used in the imperial examinations but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the southern ming court
ten bamboo studio
despite his reputation as an artist and seal carver hu was primarily a publisher his publishing house the ten bamboo studio produced reference works on calligraphy poetry and art medical textbooks books on etymology and phonetics and copies of as well as commentaries on the confucian classics unlike other publishers in the area the ten bamboo studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels this bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio s location the mountain on which hu took up residence was just to the north of the nanjing guozijian national academy which provided a captive market for academic texts between 1627 and 1644 the ten bamboo studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind aimed at a wealthy literary audience the studio s earliest publications were medical textbooks the first of which tested prescriptions for myriad illnesses wanbing yanfang was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later hu s brother zhengxin was a medical practitioner and appears to have been the author of these books
during the 1630s the ten bamboo studio also produced political works extolling the rule of the ming these included the imperial ming record of loyalty huang ming biaozhong ji a biography of loyal ming officials and the edicts of the imperial ming huang ming zhaozhi a list of imperial proclamations after the fall of the ming dynasty hu renamed the studio the hall rooted in the past digutang as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty although the ten bamboo imprint continued to be used despite hu s withdrawal from society after 1646 the studio continued to publish well into the qing dynasty for the most part focussing on seal impression catalogues showcasing hu s carving work
the ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in china at his studio hu zhengyan experimented with various forms of woodblock printing creating processes for producing multi coloured prints and embossed printed designs as a result he was able to produce some of china s first printed publications in colour using a block printing technique known as assorted block printing douban yinshua this system made use of multiple blocks each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour it was a lengthy painstaking process requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image hu also employed a related form of multiple block printing called set block printing taoban yinshua which had existed since the yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again he refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible
in some images hu employed a blind embossing technique known as embossed designs gonghua or embossed blocks gongban using an uninked imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper he used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants this was a relatively new process having been invented by hu s contemporary wu faxiang who was also a nanjing based publisher wu had used this technique for the first time in his book wisteria studio letter paper luoxuan biangu jianpu published in 1626 both hu and wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers the sale of which provided a sideline income for the ten bamboo studio
major works
hu s most notable work is the ten bamboo studio manual of painting and calligraphy shizhuzhai shuhuapu an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists including hu himself published in 1633 it consists of eight sections covering calligraphy bamboo flowers rocks birds and animals plums orchids and fruit some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes as well as a collection of artworks it was also intended as an artistic primer with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to chinese painting in this book hu used his multiple block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images rather than obvious outlines or overlaps the manual is bound in the butterfly binding hudie zhuang style whereby whole folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double page spread this binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image cambridge university library released a complete digital scan of the manual including all writings and illustrations in august 2015 said charles aylmer head of the cambridge university chinese department the binding is so fragile and the manual so delicate that until it was digitized we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it despite its undoubted importance to scholars
this volume went on to influence colour printing across china where it paved the way for the later but better known manual of the mustard seed garden jieziyuan huazhuan and also in japan where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in ukiyo e of the colour woodblock printing process known as nishiki e the popularity of the ten bamboo studio manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late qing dynasty
hu also produced the work ten bamboo studio letter paper shizhuzhai jianpu a collection of paper samples which made use of the gonghua stamped embossing technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers it also contained paintings of rocks people ritual vessels and other subjects the book was bound in the wrapped back baobei zhuang style in which the folio pages are folded stacked and sewn along the open edges originally published in 1644 it was reissued in four volumes between 1934 and 1941 by zheng zhenduo and lu xun and revised and republished again in 1952
other publications
other works produced by hu s studio included a reprint of zhou boqi s manual of seal script calligraphy the six styles of calligraphy correct and erroneous liushu zheng e and the related necessary investigations into calligraphy shufa bi ji which discussed common errors in the formation of characters with his brother zhengxin hu edited a new introductory edition of the confucian classics entitled the standardised text of the four books identified and corrected sishu dingben bianzheng 1640 giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text a similar approach was taken with the essentials of the thousand character classic in six scripts qianwen liushu tongyao 1663 which hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher li deng it was published after li s death partly in homage to him
the three hu brothers worked together to collate a student primer on poetry by their contemporary ye tingxiu which was called simply the discussion of poetry shi tan 1635 other works on poetry from the studio included helpful principles to the subtle workings of selected tang poems leixuan tang shi zhudao weiji which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included colophons by hu zhengyan himself
among the studio s more obscure publications was a text on chinese dominoes entitled paitong fuyu written under a pseudonym but with a preface by hu zhengyan

raid on manila 1798
the raid on manila of january 1798 was a royal navy false flag military operation during the french revolutionary wars intended to scout the strength of the defences of manila capital of the spanish philippines capture a manila galleon and assess the condition of the spanish navy squadron maintained in the port spain had transformed from an ally of great britain in the war of the first coalition into an enemy in 1796 thus the presence of a powerful spanish squadron at manila posed a threat to the china fleet an annual convoy of east indiaman merchant ships from macau in qing dynasty china to britain which was of vital economic importance to britain so severe was this threat that a major invasion of the spanish philippines had been planned from british india during 1797 but had been called off following the treaty of campo formio in europe and the possibility of a major war in india between the british east india company and the kingdom of mysore
to ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at macau in the winter of 1797 98 the british commander in the east indies rear admiral peter rainier sent a convoy to china escorted by the frigates hms sybille and hms fox and commanded by captain edward cooke after completing his mission cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of spanish forces in manila himself he was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from manila which would make a valuable prize sailing in sybille and accompanied by captain pulteney malcolm in fox cooke reached the spanish capital on 13 january 1798
anchored in manila bay cooke pretended that his ships were french vessels and successfully lured successive boatloads of spanish officials aboard taking them prisoner in turn once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in manila that the treasure ship had been unloaded at cavite and that the spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the pasig river capturing the gunboats in a bloodless attack cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards unsuccessfully assaulting zamboanga before returning to macau
background
in 1796 after three years of the french revolutionary wars spain and the french republic signed the treaty of san ildefonso the secret terms of this treaty required spain to renounce its alliance with great britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally in the east indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant british forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the spanish philippines to the east britain dominated the east indies in 1796 controlling the trade routes through the indian ocean from the ports of bombay madras and calcutta dutch ceylon the dutch cape colony and parts of the dutch east indies had been captured in 1795 and the french presence in the region had been confined to le de france and a few subsidiary islands in the western indian ocean
some of the most important trade routes began at canton and macau in qing dynasty china early in each year a large convoy known as the china fleet composed of large east indiaman merchant ships in the employ of the british east india company sailed westwards to europe from macau laden with tea and other commercial cargo this convoy was economically significant to britain one convoy in 1804 was valued at over 8 million the equivalent of 600 000 000 as of 2016 in january 1797 the convoy had been attacked by the french squadron in the east indies comprising six frigates commanded by contre amiral pierre c sar charles de sercey in the ensuing bali strait incident the commander deceived sercey into believing that the unescorted convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the french admiral retreated only learning of his error on his return to le de france there was considerable concern in india that sercey might try again in 1798 or that the spanish who maintained a powerful squadron at cavite might make an attempt of their own
rainier s initial impulse on learning in november 1796 of the impending declaration of war between britain and spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the philippines centred on manila in repetition of the successful british capture of manila in 1762 co operating with the governor general of india sir john shore and colonel arthur welleley among others a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation which was in the advance planning stages when unexpected news arrived in india in august 1797 announcing the treaty of campo formio which brought the war of the first coalition to an end britain now faced france and spain alone while emissaries from the tipu sultan of the kingdom of mysore an old opponent of britain in southern india were seeking french assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities the resources planned for the operation against manila were therefore retained in india and the operation cancelled but the protection of the china fleet was still essential and rainier diverted some of his squadron eastwards to china
a number of merchant ships had gathered at bombay in the spring of 1797 in preparation for the trip to macau to load trade goods and join the china fleet to escort this force rainier provided the 40 gun frigate hms sybille captured from the french at the battle of mykonos in 1794 and the 50 gun hms centurion which sailed with the convoy in july taking passage through the straits of malacca joined there by the ships of the line hms victorious and hms trident and the 32 gun frigate hms fox under captain pulteney malcolm for the final voyage to macau the convoy arrived without incident on 13 december 1797 although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses
cooke s raids
reconnaissance of manilla
with his convoy safely at anchor in macau and the china fleet several weeks from sailing cooke decided to reconnoitre manila and make observations on the port and the spanish squadron based there as an added motivation rumours in macau suggested that the annual manila galleon was due to arrive this ship brought up to two million spanish silver dollars from acapulco across the pacific ocean stopping at guam on its way to manila depositing its dollars in the philippines the ship then loaded trade goods from the east indies for the return journey to new spain this round trip was essential to the maintenance of the spanish empire in the east indies which operated at an enormous financial loss only mitigated by the substantial subsidy from new spain spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the east indies and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade but british sailors had nevertheless been attacking the manila galleons since thomas cavendish in 1587
leaving the heavier warships at macau cooke sailed on 5 january 1798 only with sybille and fox the latter carrying a mr bernard an experienced linguist passing luzon cooke s ships encountered a small spanish merchant vessel which was lured towards the frigates which were flying french tricolors seizing the spanish vessel cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the spanish squadron in manila were undergoing extensive repairs at cavite and were unfit to sail cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact although he did remove 3 900 silver dollars the spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in april 1797 and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time cooke s small squadron arrived off manila cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as french vessels modelling sybille on the powerful 40 gun forte and fox on the smaller prudente
dinner on sybille
late in the afternoon of 13 january 1798 sybille and fox arrived in manila bay slipping unchallenged past the fortress of corregidor and then sailing across the bay on the morning of 14 january anchoring between manila and cavite from his vantage point cooke could see the spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in cavite the ships of the line san pedro europa and monta s and the frigates maria de la cabeya and luisa in dock and unfit for action to cooke s disappointment he could also see the manila galleon marquesetta being unloaded at the cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship rey carlos aground in the harbour the spanish had learned only shortly before cooke s arrival that the british frigate hms resistance under captain edward pakenham was in philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack
fox was the first british ship into the anchorage and was consequently approached by the guardboat whose crew came aboard malcolm like cooke spoke french fluently and with bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new arrivals were forte and prudente seeking supplies and spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations the officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the spanish ships would be in a position to sail until march at the earliest cooke then joined the party on the deck of fox claiming to be commodore latour a french officer who unknown to the spanish had been killed in the action of 9 september 1796 off sumatra the spanish officer was now completely convinced by the ruse which had been augmented by fake french uniforms inviting the visitor below decks cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of toasts including the downfall of england
for an hour the officers drank malcolm and cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the philippines until a second boat pulled alongside fox containing more officers keen to greet the french arrivals this vessel was the personal barge of the spanish commander at cavite rear admiral don ignacio mar a de lava who was not aboard but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat each time the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at gunpoint and taken below decks as prisoners of war in malcolm s cabin the captured officers were informed of their situation promised release before the british frigates sailed and offered more wine the crew of fox meanwhile forced the captured spanish sailors to strip and donned their clothing climbing into the spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby pasig river where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored taking the crews by surprise the british boarding parties drove off the spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside fox these vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well armed one with a 32 pounder long gun and two with 24 pounder long guns each supplemented by four swivel guns
the harbour captain reached fox shortly afterwards furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned malcolm received him with a tirade of near incomprehensible french and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin while the boat s crew were imprisoned below decks shortly afterwards at 16 00 cooke and malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and grog to the crew the total number of spanish sailors on fox now numbering approximately 200 once the meal was finished cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole although he retained the captured gunboats
zamboanga
cooke led his small squadron past corregidor on 15 january and turned south four days later in a storm one of the gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again lost with its twelve crew the frigates subsequently scouted mindanao before reaching zamboanga on 22 january there cooke raised spanish colours in an attempt to deceive the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but sybille grounded on a sandbank at the entrance to the port which raised the suspicions of a guardboat sent by the governor of zamboanga raymundo espa ol the captain of the spanish boat asked the british ships the names of their captains and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle fire he put the town on alert with the defenders forewarned cooke abandoned his ruse and after refloating sybille the following morning ordered a bombardment of the fort protecting the harbour this had little effect though later the spanish recovered at least 450 cannonballs from different calibers and malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm the landward side of the fort the boats came under heavy fire one smashed by a cannonball killing two and wounding four another boat grounded on a sandbar and became stuck so with his force in disarray as 250 villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the british from the beach malcolm called off the operation after exchanging shot for an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out of range with two dead and one wounded on sybille and eight wounded on fox in addition to those lost in the boats the defenders lost a single man killed and 4 wounded
with his frigates now requiring repairs cooke withdraw half a league from zamboanga and spent three days refitting the masts and rigging of the ships then he sailed north scuttling the two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to canton four days later on 27 january the squadron halted at a village named pullock in the north of the sultanate of maguindanao to collect fresh water on the beach a boat party from sybille was set upon by lumad tribesmen two were killed and nine others taken captive and dragged into the forest before rescuers could arrive cooke complained to sultan kibab sahriyal at kuta wato and the captured sailors were eventually recovered although not before sybille and fox had sailed for china to escort the merchant convoy back to india
aftermath
cooke s opportunistic diversion had determined that the spanish forces in the philippines posed no immediate threat although the mission had cost 18 lives admiral rainier later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the admiralty more might have been achieved with reinforcements historian c northcote parkinson suggests that had cooke s squadron united with resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed spanish warships at cavite he also notes however that in this scenario pakenham would have been commanding officer a man with considerably less imagination and guile than cooke historian richard woodman was critical of the mission considering the operation to have no glorious outcome and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short coming
the 1798 china fleet sailed without further incident during the ensuing year resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in july in the bangka strait and the majority of rainier s forces were focused on disrupting the french occupation of suez in the red sea this diversion of british resources created gaps in the coverage in merchant shipping and sercey was able to send the frigate preneuse and corvette br le gueule to manila late in the year to join the repaired spanish squadron at the beginning of february 1799 this combined force sailed to macau taking the british defences by surprise the british commander captain william hargood counterattacked advancing on the franco spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the wanshan archipelago the combined squadron then dispersed and the china fleet was not attacked again until the battle of pulo aura in 1804 at which a french squadron was again driven off in confusion the frigates cooke had mimicked forte and prudente were sent to operate independently against british trade in the indian ocean in early 1799 prudente was captured by hms daedalus at the action of 9 february 1799 near southern africa and forte was intercepted by hms sybille under cooke on 28 february near balasore in bengal in the ensuing battle forte was captured but cooke mortally wounded dying on 25 may
b of the bang
b of the bang was a sculpture by thomas heatherwick next to the city of manchester stadium in manchester england which was commissioned to mark the 2002 commonwealth games it was one of the tallest structures in manchester and the tallest sculpture in the uk until the completion of aspire in 2008 it was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the leaning tower of pisa the sculpture took its name from a quotation of british sprinter linford christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the bang of the starting pistol but at the b of the bang
the sculpture was commissioned in 2003 construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 january 2005 six days before the launch the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground legal action started a year later resulting in an out of court settlement totalling 1 7 million
in february 2009 manchester city council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal the core was sold for scrap in july 2012 while the 180 spikes remain in storage
design and statistics
b of the bang originally stood 56 metres 184 ft tall with 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core it was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five 25 m 82 ft long tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes 22 m 72 ft above the ground the sculpture weighed 165 tonnes with the concrete in the foundations weighing over 1 000 tonnes including a 400 m2 4 300 sq ft reinforced concrete slab the foundations are 20 m 66 ft deep
the sculpture was made from the same weathering steel also known as cor ten as the angel of the north sculpture which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements this layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its permeability to water as part of the design the spikes swayed slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of 100 mph 160 km h at the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture containing children s poems and paintings due to be opened circa 2300 the location of the time capsule after dismantling is currently unknown
b of the bang was located next to the city of manchester stadium at sportcity in beswick at the corner of alan turing way and ashton new road it took its name from a quotation of british sprinter linford christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the bang of the starting pistol but at the b of the bang the artwork had been nicknamed kerplunk by the locals after the popular children s game from the 1970s
prior to the construction of aspire at the university of nottingham b of the bang was britain s tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the angel of the north which stands at 66 feet 20 m it was designed to look like an exploding firework and was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the leaning tower of pisa it was commissioned by new east manchester limited to commemorate the 2002 commonwealth games the design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002 and was designed by thomas heatherwick
construction and funding
the sculpture was constructed in sheffield by thomas heatherwick studio packman lucas flint and neill and westbury structures it was approved at the start of 2003 with the central core arriving in manchester on 13 june 2004 this was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory and required a police escort this central core was lifted into place in august 2004 after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of july 2003 which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname g of the bang
the official unveiling by linford christie took place on 12 january 2005
in total the sculpture cost 1 42 million to design and construct twice the original estimate as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs funding was sourced from a european regional development fund contribution of 700 000 the north west development agency contributing 500 000 and manchester city council providing 120 000
structural problems and legal action
the tip of one of the 2 1 m 6 9 ft spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on 6 january 2005 only six days before the official unveiling after inspection the event went ahead as planned
four months later in may 2005 a second spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose at that time the sculpture was closed off to the public and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed as a result some of the joints were re welded with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement this consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70 of the spikes weights
despite these modifications b of the bang remained fenced off prompting a local newspaper campaign to get it sorted in may 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis to discover the stresses being placed on the steel
it was announced in october 2007 that manchester city council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture in november 2008 this culminated in an out of court settlement being reached between manchester city council the project s designers thomas heatherwick studio ltd and the engineering and construction subcontractors packman lucas ltd flint and neill partnership and westbury structures ltd the agreement was to pay the council 1 7m in damages for breach of contract and negligence
dismantling
acting on a report in january 2009 the city council recommended that b of the bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement the report recognised the sculpture s aesthetic value for manchester and manchester city council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long term solution one possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing
in january 2009 antony gormley creator of the angel of the north to which b of the bang is often compared spoke out in support of the sculpture stating that it is a great tribute to manchester that this ground breaking work was commissioned to allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council s nerve
despite gormley s plea removal of b of the bang began in april 2009 more substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm connell brothers limited began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment
although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs these too were cut apart during removal casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture s return and in early july 2012 the core was sold as scrap for 17 000
battle of the hongorai river
the battle of the hongorai river took place during the second world war and involved australian new zealand and japanese forces part of the wider bougainville campaign of the pacific theatre the battle was fought in the southern sector of bougainville island coming after the battle of slater s knoll in which a strong japanese counterattack was defeated the battle occurred in two distinct periods between 17 april and 22 may 1945 as elements of the australian 15th brigade advanced south along the buin road
the initial phase saw the australians advance towards the hongorai river following the end of the early fighting the australian advance towards the main japanese concentration at buin continued as they struck out towards the hari and mivo rivers this continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective washing away many bridges and roads upon which the australians relied for supplies as the australian advance stalled the japanese began harassing the australian line of communications and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late july and into august the australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards buin again ultimately though the war came to an end before the final australian advance began bringing the campaign to an end
background
strategic situation
japanese forces had landed on bougainville in early 1942 capturing it from the small force of australians garrisoning the island they had subsequently developed several airbases on the island using it to conduct operations in the northern solomon islands and to attack the allied lines of communication between the united states australia and the southwest pacific area these bases also helped protect rabaul the major japanese garrison and naval base in papua new guinea and throughout 1943 allied planners determined that bougainville was vital for neutralising the japanese base around rabaul
us marines conducted an amphibious landing at cape torokina on the western coast of the island north of empress augusta bay in november 1943 after an initial counter attack the us marines had been replaced by a garrison of us army troops who began consolidating their position around torokina establishing a strong perimeter in march 1944 the japanese launched a heavy counter attack which was turned back with heavy casualties after this the situation on bougainville became largely static as the japanese focused primarily on subsistence and the us forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around torokina
in late 1944 as part of plans to free us troops up for the philippines campaign the australian ii corps consisting of mainly militia troops under the command of lieutenant general stanley savige took over responsibility for allied operations on bougainville from the american xiv corps australian forces began arriving on the island between november and december 1944 initially establishing themselves around the us base at torokina due to inaccurate intelligence savige mistakenly believed that the japanese forces on the island numbered just 17 500 men and he consequently decided that the australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the japanese from bougainville in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere rather than maintaining the defensive posture the us forces had adopted however allied estimates of japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40 000
the campaign that australian planners developed entailed three separate drives in the north it was planned that japanese forces would be forced into the narrow bonis peninsula and contained in the centre the seizure of pearl ridge would give the australians control of the east west avenues of approach as well as affording them protection against further counter attacks while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast and the main campaign in the south where the bulk of the japanese forces were concentrated around buin
preliminary moves
following the capture of pearl ridge in december 1944 the australian 7th brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards buin in late march and early april 1945 they had fought the battle of slater s knoll after which a brief lull followed as the australians paused to shorten their supply lines meanwhile the survivors of the japanese force heavily demoralised by their defeat withdrew towards the hongorai river the australian 3rd division was then ordered to resume its advance south being tasked with capturing the hari river while the hongorai was also included as an intermediate objective japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the australians at about 10 500 men of which 2 300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd division the 15th brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the australian units on bougainville at the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th brigade which was in need of rest
under the command of brigadier heathcote hammer the 15th brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the 2 4th armoured regiment engineers from the 15th field company a battery of 155 mm guns from u heavy battery field artillery from the 2nd field regiment and a number of smaller support units the 58th 59th infantry battalion took over responsibility for slater s knoll replacing the 25th infantry battalion while the 24th infantry battalion took up a position across the buin road the brigade s third battalion the 57th 60th infantry battalion did not join them until the beginning of may and so the 7th brigade s 9th infantry battalion continued patrolling operations north of the huio river in the rumiki area until the 57th 60th could dispatch elements to relieve them further inland the 2 8th commando squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south east defending the brigade s left or eastern flank
the japanese forces opposing the australians belonged to the 6th division under the command of lieutenant general tsutomu akinaga akinaga had been ordered to delay the australian advance between the hongorai and the hari for as long as possible and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the australian s expected line of advance the division s infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around slater s knoll and as a consequence several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated the front line positions were assigned to the 6th field artillery regiment while the 13th infantry regiment was to hold five strongpoints to their rear along and astride the buin road designated a through to e the 6th field and 4th field heavy artillery regiments both held strongpoints further back designated f and g the 23rd infantry regiment was placed in the rear where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack on slater s knoll
battle
advance to the hongorai
the 15th brigade took over the forward positions from the 7th brigade on 17 april initial dispositions had the 24th infantry battalion on the buin road around kero creek with the 58th 59th around barara north east of slater s knoll and the 57th 60th when it arrived to relieve the 9th would be positioned further east astride a secondary parallel track known to the australians as the commando road two days later hammer received the order to commence the advance towards the hongorai from savige who offered him the support of the 29th brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter attack in a change to the tactics that the australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around slater s knoll from early may they advanced on a two battalion front instead of one the 24th infantry battalion was in the van moving along the buin road with the 58th 59th protecting its flank and rear while 5 000 yd 4 600 m further inland the 57th 60th infantry battalion commencing on 3 may advanced along the commando road from rumiki after taking over from the 9th infantry battalion
moving forward under a creeping barrage as they moved beyond tokinotu the 24th infantry battalion was the first to contact the japanese carrying out an attack against japanese positions around dawe s creek on 17 april supported by a troop of matilda tanks from the 2 4th armoured regiment an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells two infantry companies c and d from the 24th attacked the position while another a company carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards kindara and hatai the left forward company d company reached its objective without trouble however c company on the right along with the troop of tanks came up against stiff japanese resistance and became bogged down a company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the hatai track in support of a company matilidas came forward and raked the jungle hacking through the undergrowth to reveal several japanese pillboxes which were destroyed by the australian armour as night fell c company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning engineers were brought forward as was a bulldozer and the gap was bridged amidst heavy fighting the australians forced their way across the creek by the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation 400 yd 370 m beyond the creek 37 japanese had been killed for the loss of seven australians killed and 19 wounded after this the australians continued their advance towards sindou creek which was a further 1 mi 1 6 km to the southeast in response the japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week although these were turned back during this time the australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements one of which managed to slip through the japanese defensive positions either side of the buin road and carried out a reconnaissance of the hongorai river about 1 000 yd 910 m south of the main crossing further patrols were carried out as well as a number of ambushes before the advance was resumed on 26 april
resuming their advance the australians were supported by three squadrons of corsairs from the royal new zealand air force nos 14 22 and 26 squadrons which bombed and strafed the ground in front of the advancing infantry as well as a creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire with such strong support the japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th infantry battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the hongorai for just one man wounded further progress was made over the next week but on 4 may the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun mines and other improvised explosive devices after this the 15th brigade s engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the australian armour to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines the japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also to negate the effectiveness of the australian tanks the japanese began to position themselves off the roads forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support additionally the japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry which they kept under constant observation and fire
meanwhile the previous day 3 may the 57th 60th infantry battalion had begun operating along the parallel commando road to the north here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling which resulted in them being ambushed they also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching and crossing the river arriving there on 6 may on 5 may along the buin road the 24th infantry battalion had pressed forward again advancing with a tank troop in support they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 japanese after the lead matilda s machine gun jammed the field gun opened fire on it damaging it and wounding its crew moving around the stricken tank the second matilda armed with a howitzer opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the japanese defenders from the position that night the japanese artillery opened up on the australian position with a heavy barrage and the following morning put in a company sized counter attack the fighting lasted for over two and a half hours but when it was over the australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack in doing so they suffered one killed and nine wounded while the attacking japanese had suffered heavily losing 58 men killed it was the biggest loss since the action at slater s knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the hongorai
after this the australians were able to resume their advance to the river on 7 may without further opposition the previous three weeks in which they had advanced 7 000 yd 6 400 m to the hongorai had been costly for them however with the australian 24th infantry battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded against this the japanese had lost at least 169 killed
crossing the hongorai
following the advance to the hongorai there was a pause of about a week as the australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up before attempting to cross the hongorai en masse this allowed savige to re evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the hari and mivo rivers as they waited for the advance to resume the australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time as a part of these the 24th infantry battalion sent a company across the hongorai and subsequently located a strong japanese position on a feature that became known as egan s ridge which due to its location commanded the main australian axis of advance
the main crossing was planned for 20 may with the 58th 59th infantry battalion on the right tasked to cut the buin road and the aitara track to the east of the river while on the left the 57th 60th infantry battalion would divert the attention of the japanese off the 24th infantry battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the australian line crossing at the pororei ford advancing straight up the buin road preliminary moves began before this and on 15 may a platoon from the 24th infantry battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on egan s ridge after one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a japanese field gun they were forced to withdraw meanwhile the rnzaf corsair squadrons now reinforced by no 16 squadron began an eight day aerial campaign attacking along the length of the buin and commando roads during this period the new zealanders flew 381 sorties while artillery and mortars fired thousands of rounds
two days later on 17 may the 57th 60th infantry battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank crossing the hongorai inland and advancing along the commando road with 32 corsairs and two batteries of artillery in support crossing 500 yd 460 m north of the ford the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing nevertheless shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on 20 may
in the centre the main attack along the buin road began at 08 30 on 20 may after 20 minutes of strafing by new zealand corsairs had prepared the ground advancing under a creeping barrage and with mortar and machine gun support the 24th infantry battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve along with two troops of matilda tanks mostly the forward companies reached their objectives but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded the attack was resumed the following day and the australians were able to advance to the pororei ford however they were prevented from moving any further as the japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an australian patrol encountered 70 japanese and were forced to go to ground finally a company from the 24th infantry battalion was able to move on to the high ground on egan s ridge which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature
on the right flank the 58th 59th infantry battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the hongorai by bulldozer beginning their move two days earlier a number of patrols had had contacts with the japanese meanwhile using tractors to drag the tanks through the mud the australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 00 on 20 may the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river unbeknown to the japanese the following day the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing and further delayed by stiff resistance later after one of the battalion s patrols came under heavy fire the tanks moved up and attacked a japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition
by 22 may although there were still a number of japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications most of the australian objectives had been secured and mopping up operations began the last remaining defensive location before the hongorai was egan s ridge where the japanese were sheltering in tunnels a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge it was subsequently occupied by a company of australian infantry within a short period of time the buin road was subsequently opened providing the australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign being the advance to the hari mobiai and mivo rivers the final phase of the battle cost the japanese 106 killed while the australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded
aftermath
during the course of the fighting around the hongorai the australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded while the japanese lost at least 275 men killed following the battle the australians continued their advance towards buin at the southern end of the island throughout the remainder of the month and into june the 15th brigade advanced along the buin road crossing the hari on 10 june beyond the river the japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply and they consequently occupied a series of deep entrenchments these were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery and the 15th brigade subsequently crossed mobiai river before being relieved by brigadier noel simpson s 29th brigade in early july
as the 29th brigade advanced toward the mivo river torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt the height of the river rose 2 metres 6 6 ft the buin road was reduced in the words of gavin long to a sea of mud and many of the bridges upon which the australian supply system was dependent were washed away this rendered large scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the australians even ceased patrolling operations across the mivo meanwhile the japanese continued to harass the australians probing their positions and setting mines and traps targeting the australian line of communications on 9 july the 15th infantry battalion fought off a series of attacks around siskatekori at the junction of the mivo river and the buin road which included a heavy japanese artillery bombardment australian patrols were resumed in late july and continued into august these attacks proved very costly particularly amongst the australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding
fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards buin continued into august combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed as a result the final australian operations on bougainville took place on the ratsua front in the northern sector where the australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at porton plantation had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the bonis peninsula by mid august however following the dropping of two atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki and japan s subsequent unconditional surrender a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this it spelt an end to major combat operations
following the end of the war the australian army awarded three battle honours for the fighting around the hongorai river the 2 4th armoured regiment and the 9th 24th 57th 60th and 58th 59th infantry battalions received the battle honour hongorai river a second battle honour egan s ridge hongorai ford was also awarded to the 2 4th armoured regiment and the 24th and 58th 59th infantry battalions for the second stage of the fighting while the 57th 60th infantry battalion received the separate battle honour of commando road for this period
sonic the hedgehog 1991 video game
sonic the hedgehog is a platform video game developed by sonic team and published by sega for the sega genesis console the game was first released in north america europe and australia in june 1991 and in japan the following month the game features an anthropomorphic hedgehog named sonic in a quest to defeat dr robotnik a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical chaos emeralds sonic the hedgehog s gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button
the game s development began in 1990 when sega ordered its am8 development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company after considering a number of suggestions the developers decided on a blue hedgehog with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves sonic team to match their character sonic the hedgehog designed for fast gameplay was influenced by the games of super mario series creator shigeru miyamoto sonic the hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows sonic s sprite to roll along curved scenery which originated in a tech demo created by the game s programmer yuji naka
the game was well received by critics who praised its visuals music and speed of gameplay the game was also commercially successful establishing the genesis as a key player in the 16 bit era and allowing it to compete with nintendo and their super nes console it has been ported a number of times and inspired several clones a successful franchise and adaptations by other media
plot
in an attempt to steal the six chaos emeralds and harness their power the game s antagonist dr ivo robotnik has trapped the animal inhabitants of south island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules the player controls sonic who aims to halt robotnik s plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the emeralds himself
if the player collects all the chaos emeralds and completes the game a reward ending sequence is shown if all the emeralds are not collected robotnik taunts the player while juggling the chaos emeralds instead
gameplay
sonic the hedgehog is a 2d side scrolling platformer whose gameplay centers around sonic s ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs slopes high falls and loop the loops the levels contain hazards in the form of robots badniks in the western game manuals inside of which dr robotnik has trapped animals although destroying a robot frees the animal within this is not required to complete the game the player must avoid rows of sharp spikes falling into bottomless pits being crushed by moving walls or platforms and drowning which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents sonic s main attack is his spin where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly damaging enemies and some obstacles this can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground
scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life rings are a layer of protection against hazards if sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or obstacle he will survive however all his rings will be scattered they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again if sonic is hit without any rings he loses a life although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection certain hazards such as drowning being crushed falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time will cost sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection
the game is divided into six zones green hill marble spring yard labyrinth star light and scrap brain each with its own visual style and enemies a player must navigate through each zone subdivided into three acts to progress at the end of each zone s third act the player confronts dr robotnik who pilots a different vehicle each time in a boss fight after the sixth zone the player continues directly to the final zone for a last encounter with robotnik
the player begins with three lives power ups and rings add more which are lost when sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects without rings falls off screen or exceeds an act s ten minute time limit lampposts acting as checkpoints allow sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life if he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life the timer will reset to 0 00 when he returns to the checkpoint if all lives are lost at any point in the game the game over screen will appear when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives if they have any continues
when sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a special stage a secret zone in the original genesis manual in each of six special stages sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found their main goal is to obtain the chaos emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a goal block which ends the level
development
background and character design
in 1990 sega ordered its in house development studio am8 to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company this was a position already held by the character alex kidd but he was considered similar to mario and deemed unsatisfactory sega president hayao nakayama wanted a character as iconic as mickey mouse sega had competition from nintendo and its mascot mario in mind nintendo was dominant at the time particularly after the release of the successful super mario bros 3 and sega wanted a foothold in the industry although the company had some success with genesis ports of its arcade titles it knew this would not be enough
am8 developed ideas for characters an engine and gameplay mechanics development emphasized speed so am8 eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals as well as fast creatures like kangaroos and squirrels one idea a rabbit able to grasp objects with prehensile ears showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware the team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball their idea for an attacking move designers then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough so they focused on two animals with spikes armadillos and hedgehogs the hedgehog character first proposed by naoto ohshima prevailed although the armadillo would later become the basis for mighty the armadillo who first appeared in 1993 s segasonic the hedgehog ohshima has admitted since that he created sonic s basic design by combining felix the cat s head with mickey mouse s body
sonic was originally teal colored then a light shade of blue but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the sega logo his shoes were colored red through the inspiration of michael jackson s boots on the album cover for bad and the outfit of santa claus whom ohshima saw as the most famous character in the world sonic s spikes were emphasized to make him look sleeker and he was given the ability to spin while jumping so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button the new character was originally named mr needlemouse but the eight member am8 changed his name to sonic and their studios to sonic team ideas proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band giving him vampire fangs and giving him a human girlfriend named madonna but sega of america scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple sega of america also expressed concerns that most americans would not know what a hedgehog is and initially proposed a full scale recreation of the character but compromised with sonic team to simply make design changes the antagonist ended up being named dr eggman in japan and dr robotnik in other regions as a result of a dispute between sega s american and japanese divisions
programming and prototyping
with a satisfying protagonist completed sega turned to esteemed programmer yuji naka who had impressed them through his work on phantasy star and the genesis port of ghouls n ghosts the gameplay originated with a tech demo by naka who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix naka s prototype was a platform game with a fast moving character rolling in a ball through a long winding tube and this concept was fleshed out with ohshima s character designs and levels by designer hirokazu yasuhara yasuhara originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the united states by the outbreak of the gulf war but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year his designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design the game s color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist eizin suzuki and the aesthetics of green hill were influenced by the geography of california
in designing the game mechanics naka was inspired by shigeru miyamoto whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier admiring the simplicity of miyamoto s mechanics in complex environments naka decided that sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping he also wanted his creation to be more action oriented than the mario series while playing super mario bros he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly due to the need to demonstrate the genesis technological prowess the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign a process taking over six months the developers efforts were rewarded according to yuji naka the game had the fastest ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console the team intended to add a two player mode displayed via split screen but naka s programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature however such a mode would later appear in sequel sonic the hedgehog 2 1992 where the second player would control sonic s best friend miles tails prower naka oshima and yasuhara worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months
naka s relationship with sega of japan was tenuous during this time he received little credit for his involvement in the game he left the company shortly after the game s release although sega of america hired him later before leaving however he defied sega of japan s prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background identifiable only by looking at the game s code
music
the music for sonic the hedgehog was composed and produced by masato nakamura bassist and lead songwriter of the j pop band dreams come true the game uses onboard yamaha ym2612 and sn76489 programmable sound generators to produce a variety of stereo sound effects and music it was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations of sonic breakdancing to the music of a sonic band of sharps chicken on guitar max monkey on bass mach rabbit on drums and vector the crocodile on keyboard the playable vector became a recurring character in the series also appearing in knuckles chaotix sonic heroes and sonic free riders the development schedule scrapped the feature and yuji naka replaced the test with the se ga chant used in tv commercials which reportedly used one eighth of the memory of the four megabit cartridge
on october 19 2011 twenty years after the game s release a three disc compilation of music from sonic the hedgehog and sonic the hedgehog 2 was released in japan the first disc features original tracks from both games the second contains masato nakamura s demo recordings and the third comprises songs by dreams come true and their akon remixes
packaging and release
game package illustrator akira watanabe said that his goal was to make the characters colorful using clear lines and gradation to finish them neatly according to watanabe the developers asked him to create a package design similar to pop art without being particular to conventional packages something original and stylish the game was released in north america europe and australia on june 23 1991 and in japan on july 26 sega of america packaged it with american genesis consoles replacing altered beast genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of sonic the hedgehog by mail sega of america created a large scale marketing campaign to promote the game and sonic as a mascot for the company
alternate versions and ports
8 bit version

production
co creators j j abrams alex kurtzman and roberto orci and executive producer jeff pinkner wrote the episode paul a edwards served as the director his first such credit for the series in developing fringe the co creators did not want to make the series too serialized as this was a complaint often directed at abrams television series alias they wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content and studied procedural dramas such as law and order and csi crime scene investigation for inspiration kurztman explained while we make sure that our episodes are self contained have a beginning a middle and an end the character stories can be serialized they don t have to resolve themselves over the course of one show the same old story was fringe s first regular episode and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured
the episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series different departments for the scene in which they remove the victim s eyeball the special effects crew created a mold based on actress elizabeth stanley s head using plaster to make a prosthetic they drilled out the eyeball and sculpt ed it open and went through a series of molds stanley stated that it s really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me even though it s very gruesome because the eyeball s popping out the prop department rigged a weapon which they called a photon gun according to prop master peter gelfman this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people s clothing for concealed weapons vfx supervisor christopher scollard explained that for the eye s last vision they used a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location which they then used to take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab
the same old story featured guest appearances by actors derek cecil as christopher penrose and mark blum as his father dr claus penrose other guest actors included betty gilpin as loraine amber daisy alcott bernie mcinerney as old christopher penrose carmen goodine as amy ty jones as a doctor and karin agstam as john scott s sister
reception
ratings
the same old story was watched by 13 272 million viewers in the united states a 45 percent increase of four million from the pilot fox claimed that this ratings improvement was the best for any new network drama series in over five years its high rated lead in house helped boost fringe s ratings for the night as 93 percent of house s total audience and 95 percent of 18 to 49 year olds stayed to watch fringe fringe was also the highest rated program for male 18 to 54 year olds that evening
reviews
the same old story received mixed reviews from television critics tv squad writer jane boursaw thought the episode seemed all over the place and wasn t sure what to think she stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when walter removed the girl s eye in order to identity her killer and the cliffhanger at the very end when walter states if you ve read my file then you know the truth about peter s medical history travis fickett of ign thought it was better than the pilot though it was laden with lots of clunky exposition and clich d dialogue fickett understood that it was needed to acquaint new viewers to the show fickett concluded his review by saying fringe has the potential to be a great show and he also praised the production level as top notch and torv s performance as very good as she brings a unique presence to the show the a v club critic noel murray gave the episode a c while television without pity graded it with a b
josh jackson of paste magazine disliked the deus ex machina aspects that neatly solved the puzzles of the first two episodes and also criticized perceived plot contrivances like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim despite these flaws jackson said he would tune in next week because he would rather have a show err on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable and i m interested to see if abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve erin fox of tv guide also liked the same old story better than the pilot because she thought that it had really cool special effects awesome walter isms and actual chemistry forming between olivia and peter and we also got to delve more into the connections between walter nina sharp massive dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before walter was institutionalized
a ugo networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes but after sitting down to watch fringe s second episode the same old story my concerns have vanished fringe s second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without sacrificing any of fringe s eleven herbs and spices in fact the subtle framework of what makes fringe not x files is even better defined in the first weekly episode i d struggled to find the word to describe it and the winner is condensed the same old story has all of the sense of mystery discovery and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller more combustible space another ugo writer alex zalben later compared the same old story to the similarly plotted the x files episode d d kalm zalben concluded that fringe wins this one just for having a slightly less stupid explanation
randy blythe manslaughter case
the randy blythe manslaughter case was a court case in the czech republic stemming from a 2010 lamb of god concert in prague wherein 19 year old fan daniel nosek sustained head injuries leading to a coma and subsequent death during the investigation czech police unsuccessfully asked united states authorities for cooperation when the band returned to the czech republic for another concert two years later its vocalist randy blythe was arrested charged with causing nosek s death and remanded in custody for five weeks
according to a verdict delivered by the municipal court in prague on march 5 2013 it was proven that blythe had thrown nosek offstage and thus had moral responsibility for his death however due to the circumstances blythe was not held criminally liable and most of the blame lay with promoters and security members the acquittal was upheld by the prague high court on june 5 2013
2010 concert incident
during a concert on may 24 2010 in the prague club abaton blythe was involved in an incident that resulted in the death of daniel nosek a 19 year old attending fan according to eyewitness statements cited by the czech online daily newspaper aktu ln cz following blythe s arrest blythe was chanting come on up between songs which the newspaper stated may have been intended to invite applause from the audience and not a direct invitation to fans the newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb onstage and was thrown by the singer from the stage falling backwards directly on his head according to the same paper nosek was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol suffered serious brain trauma fell into a coma and died weeks later from his injuries
a report about the concert at issue released on may 26 2010 by topzine cz stated that one of the things that was unexpected was the behavior of the singer randall blythe who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage the article also contains pictures one of them showing blythe holding a fan down on the ground meanwhile another report released two days after the concert by metalopolis net alleged that randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an impertinent fan who has climbed the podium several times the front man clearly showed that it is his territory he struck the intruder down punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium without even stopping singing on may 28 2010 the report by marastmusic com stated that some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage while abysszine com stated that the only negative thing about the concert was to say it mildly disputable approach of the band towards the stage divers when somebody tried to climb the stage he was brutally swept down

according to blythe s attorney martin radvan the police launched an investigation following the death of nosek about a month after the concert and following a coma after interviewing several eyewitnesses from the concert the police asked the united states department of justice to take part in the investigation however they refused to cooperate and moreover did not notify anyone from lamb of god or its management

nosek s friend jan jebav testified that nosek climbed the stage and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by blythe off the stage he said he was 100 sure blythe pushed nosek with both hands he further said that blythe s behavior deviated from all the concerts he had attended in the past commenting that blythe was visibly furious he further claimed that nosek was not the first person to be chased off the stage by blythe with another fan being kicked choked and receiving a punch from blythe jebav corroborated blythe s testimony that blythe asked are you okay after nosek fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply however as nosek fell sick after the concert they called him an ambulance according to jebav the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it
nosek s other friend ond ej vlach testified that nosek s fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage according to him blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off while the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage nosek fell directly on the ground according to vlach there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break vlach further testified that after the fall nosek went to sit on a bench where he was fetched a water bottle nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge at the back of his head they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion vlach said that he understood blythe s gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage
another person to testify was robert havelka who worked as a security guard the night of the incident havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage he testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured he further said that the fan s fall might have been helped by someone else perhaps the singer though he did not see it precisely
blythe s defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court among other things one of the witnesses originally alleged that nosek and blythe shook hands or that one of them offered hand to another on stage however at the court hearing he testified that there was no prior contact between them blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior
day 3 of the trial
milan po dek the fan whom blythe admitted to shoving off the stage testified on the third day of the trial po dek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage po dek testified that blythe knocked him down knelt on him and held him down for a moment but blythe definitely did not choke him he also admitted that taking into account the fact that he po dek was drunk and the way he acted blythe s reaction was adequate he commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage
another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that blythe s behavior was standard to metal concerts saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception she said that it was evident that blythe did not want any fans on the stage neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of nosek s fall at the end of the concert

randy blythe was called again to the stand that day the judge first alerted him that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions the judge went again through the blythe s testimony and with a view to the previous witness statements asked blythe whether he insists that it was milan po dek whom blythe threw off the stage blythe responded by saying to the best of my knowledge it was milan po dek who was coming up on stage every time
also that day expert medical witness michal pogo i took the stand according to the prague post pogo i testified that nosek s cause of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the brainstem pogo i added that the mortality rate from this kind of injury is around 40 percent and that doctors couldn t have done more to save the patient nosek was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue where the initial diagnosis took place since this hospital did not have a specialized neurology department nosek was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis there nosek underwent two operations first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone

a defense appointed expert witness in the field of biomechanics testified on march 5 that nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward he could not have sustained an injury to the back of his head he further said that if nosek fell over the first row of the fans he must have been not only pushed but must have jumped himself the state attorney immediately attacked this testimony claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies according to which nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall the presiding judge agreed with the state attorney on some of his points
in his closing speech the state attorney asked the court to incarcerate blythe for 5 years claiming that even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury
a nosek family representative said that based on the witness testimonies the family did not believe that blythe was solely responsible he continued that he would not be substantiating the requested amount as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered he further added that daniel had died on his father s birthday and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work
in his closing word blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so he further commented that in case of acquittal measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at lamb of god concerts again
first instance verdict
on march 5 2013 the court delivered a verdict according to which blythe was not criminally liable for nosek s death even though he had the moral responsibility for it consequently the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of blythe s bail
the court held that it was proven that blythe had thrown nosek off the stage however blythe due to his nearsightedness could have mistaken nosek for the other fan who had repeatedly gotten over the guardrail according to the court the largest part of the blame lies with the promoters and security members judge kubovec further reproached blythe for not having met with the nosek family
the state attorney announced that he would appeal the verdict
appeals verdict
the state attorney s appeal was heard by a panel of three judges of the prague high court chaired by judge ji ln ni ka the hearing took place in blythe s absence blythe s acquittal was upheld by the panel on june 5 2013
the verdict may have been appealed by the supreme state attorney ssa to the supreme court as the appeal hasn t been lodged by ssa within two months of the delivery of written second instance verdict it has become final
in 2015 blythe demanded ca czk 15 millions for damages but the municipal court for prague 2 dismissed the suit
reaction
in reaction to the arrest and detention a fan created a petition at the official white house petition site by the time blythe was released on bail it gathered over 27 500 signatures
on july 7 2012 there was a vigil organized in lamb of god s hometown of richmond virginia by a friend of blythe s at the event gwar who are also from richmond frontman dave brockie said i don t think it was right for him to be arrested i don t think it was right for him to be locked up this stuff could have all been worked out diplomatically or legally before he got there in addition to brockie other notable figures in heavy metal such as tom araya and david draiman have also come out in support of blythe
in a post to his blog blythe explained that he met the nosek family in private after the trial and promised them to be a spokesperson for safer shows he emphasized that the family never attacked him and just wanted to know the truth of what had happened to their son
u s route 2 in michigan
us highway 2 us 2 is a component of the united states numbered highway system that connects everett washington to the upper peninsula up of the us state of michigan with a separate segment that runs from rouses point new york to houlton maine in michigan the highway runs through the up in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system entering the state at ironwood and ending at st ignace in between us 2 briefly traverses the state of wisconsin as one of the major transportation arteries in the up us 2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern midwest states two sections of the roadway are included as part of the great lakes circle tours and other segments are listed as state designated pure michigan byways there are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along us 2 that date to the 1910s and 1920s the highway runs through rural sections of the up passing through two national and two state forests in the process
the route of what became us 2 was used as part of two indian trails before european settlers came to the up and as part of the michigan segments of the theodore roosevelt international highway and the king s international highway auto trails in the early 20th century the state later included these trails as part of m 12 when the first state highway trunklines were designated in 1919 most of m 12 was redesignated as part of us 2 when the us highway system was created on november 11 1926 since the 1930s several changes have reshaped the highway s routing through the up one such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with hurley wisconsin and others pushed an originally inland routing of us 2 closer to the lake michigan shoreline with the creation of the interstate highway system part of us 2 was rerouted to coincide with the new interstate 75 i 75 though in the 1980s the u s highway was truncated and removed from the i 75 freeway resulting in today s basic form
route description
according to a 2006 regional planning committee report us 2 is a key highway for michigan providing its main western gateway the roadway plays an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the midwest and is listed on the national highway system nhs for its entire length the nhs is a network of roadways important to the country s economy defense and mobility together with m 28 us 2 is part of a pair of primary trunklines that bridge the eastern and western sides of the up the 305 151 miles 491 093 km of roadway in michigan is divided into a 109 177 mile 175 703 km western segment and a 195 974 mile 315 390 km eastern segment interrupted by a section that runs for 14 460 miles 23 271 km in the state of wisconsin
western segment
us 2 enters michigan from wisconsin for the first time north of downtown hurley wisconsin and ironwood michigan over the state line that runs along the montreal river the highway crosses the river into gogebic county and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown running along cloverland drive us 2 meets its only business route in michigan at douglas boulevard the business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown ironwood and crossed the border into hurley and back to the main highway the wisconsin department of transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line us 2 continues eastward through up woodlands to the city of bessemer while bypassing the community of ramsay the highway crosses a branch of the black river the roadway enters wakefield on the south side of sunday lake meeting m 28 at a stoplight in town as the us highway leaves wakefield it turns southeasterly through the ottawa national forest crossing jackson creek and two branches of the presque isle river us 2 and m 64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the presque isle in the community of marenisco this concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state in 2010 the michigan department of transportation mdot recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770 vehicles compared to the overall average of 5 188 vehicles for the highway at the end of the concurrency m 64 turns northerly to run along lake gogebic
the highway continues parallel to the state line from the marensico area through the national forest toward watersmeet that unincorporated community is the home of the watersmeet high school nimrods the basketball team featured on a series of espn commercials and a documentary series on the sundance channel the area is also where the waters meet the rolling hills drain to lake superior via the ontonagon river to lake michigan via the brule and menominee rivers or to the gulf of mexico via the wisconsin and mississippi rivers also located in the area are the sylvania wilderness and the lac vieux desert indian reservation which includes the lac vieux desert casino and resort the highway travels southeasterly from watersmeet around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural iron county us 2 intersects federal forest highway 16 ffh 16 near golden lake in stambaugh township in the middle of the national forest the trunkline then runs along the iron river as it approaches the city of the same name and meets m 73 in town us 2 intersects m 189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city
us 2 leaves the ottawa national forest at iron river and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to crystal falls the county seat of iron county on the west side of town us 2 meets us 141 the two highways run concurrently along crystal avenue the combined highway turns south onto 5th street and meets m 69 s eastern terminus at the intersection between 5th street and superior avenue next to the county courthouse at the top of the hill us 2 us 141 runs south out of crystal falls to the west of and parallel to the paint river the roadway passes railroad kennedy and stager lakes and leaves the state of michigan at the brule river crossing into florence county wisconsin for about 14 miles 23 km
eastern segment
us 2 us 141 re enters michigan where it crosses the menominee river and subsequently meets m 95 in breitung township north of iron mountain and kingsford the highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on stephenson avenue into iron mountain along the west side of lake antoine parallel to a branch line of the escanaba and lake superior railroad els railroad the road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the chapin mine in downtown iron mountain at ludington street m 95 turns west off stephenson avenue to run across town to kingsford us 2 us 141 exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the midtown mall the highway re enters breitung township where us 141 separates to the south to re enter wisconsin us 2 continues eastward parallel to a branch of the canadian national railway cn railway both road and rail travel through the community of quinnesec where they pass near the largest paper mill in the up the trunkline runs along the main street of norway where the highway meets the eastern terminus of us 8 then us 2 continues east through rural dickinson county to vulcan passing north of hanbury lake through the copper country state forest before crossing the sturgeon river in loretto and passing into menominee county
in menominee county the environment takes on a more agricultural character along us 2 the highway passes through the edge of the community of hermansville before entering powers us 2 comes to a three way intersection and turns northeast merging onto us 41 the concurrent highway runs from powers through the communities of wilson and spaulding on the south side of the cn railway at harris the trunkline enters the hannahville indian community harris is on the menominee county side of the reservation but as the highway continues east it crosses over to bark river on the delta county side the county line in between not only separates the two communities but also serves as the boundary between the central and eastern time zones east of bark river the highway crosses the community s namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of m 69 the roadway crosses the ford river prior to turning due east into the outskirts of escanaba
us 2 us 41 widens to four lanes along ludington street which forms the east west axis of the escanaba street grid near downtown the highway meets m 35 which runs along the city s north south axis lincoln avenue the trunklines merge and run north bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor lincoln avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the upper peninsula state fairgrounds site of one of the two state fairs for the state of michigan the only state to have twin fairs us 2 us 41 m 35 continues north on lincoln avenue past the campus of bay de noc community college the four lane highway crosses the escanaba river just upstream from its mouth near the large mead paper mill and shifts to run immediately next to little bay de noc the section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of us 2 in the state an average of 23 977 vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in 2011
the road turns inland again and us 2 us 41 m 35 passes to the west of downtown gladstone the highway through here is an expressway four lanes divided by a central median and no driveway access unlike a freeway the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges the highway intersects the eastern terminus of county road 426 cr 426 and crosses the els railroad south of the stoplight for 4th avenue north where m 35 separates from the us highways and turns to the northwest the expressway continues north parallel to the cn railway crossing the days river through this area the trunkline carries a speed limit of 65 mph 105 km h for car traffic this is the only road in the up with a speed limit higher than 55 mph 89 km h besides i 75 which has a speed limit of 70 mph 110 km h the expressway segment runs around the upper end of little bay de noc before ending at rapid river in this location us 41 separates to the north and us 2 returns to an easterly track as a two lane road crossing the rapid and whitefish rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay as us 2 crosses southern delta county it passes through the western unit of the hiawatha national forest near garden corners the highway runs along the shore of big bay de noc after the intersection with the northern terminus of m 183 us 2 turns inland cutting across the base of the garden peninsula and enters schoolcraft county
as the highway approaches thompson us 2 leaves the western unit of the hiawatha national forest and enters the lake superior state forest the roadway runs along lake michigan to manistique crossing the manistique river the trunkline turns inland approaching gulliver and then turns north northeast to blaney park the community there is a former logging town turned resort at the southern terminus of m 77 the resort was active from the late 1920s but declined by the 1980s from blaney park us 2 turns due east and crosses into mackinac county west of gould city where it intersects a former routing the main highway crosses the cn railway one last time and runs to the south of engadine to follow the lake michigan shoreline through naubinway after passing the community of epoufette us 2 crosses the cut river bridge 147 feet 45 m over the cut river the highway crosses into the eastern unit of the hiawatha national forest near brevort running between lake michigan and brevort lake in the process the road continues along the lake michigan shoreline passing mystery spot near gros cap and turning inland immediately west of st ignace the us 2 designation ends at the highway s partial cloverleaf interchange with i 75 the roadway continues easterly into downtown st ignace as business loop i 75 bl i 75
history
indian trail through auto trails
in 1701 the first transportation routes through what became the state of michigan were the lakes rivers and indian trails two of these trails followed parts of the future us 2 the sault green bay trail roughly followed the lake michigan shoreline routing of us 2 between escanaba and st ignace the mackinac trail connected st ignace with sault ste marie
in the age of the auto trail the roads that later formed us 2 through the up were given a few different highway names when the original roadways between ironwood and iron river were completed in late 1915 the upper peninsula development bureau updb named the area cloverland and the highway the cloverland trail later the name was extended over the highway to escanaba and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s the name was phased out by the updb completely in 1927 the roadways were also used for the theodore roosevelt international highway named for former us president theodore roosevelt after his death in 1919 overall this highway ran from portland oregon to portland maine by way of michigan and the canadian province of ontario through the up the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to us 2 including the section through florence county wisconsin
the great lakes automobile route was established in 1917 by the updb a predecessor of the great lakes circle tours by seventy years the route followed a circular journey along the banks of lakes michigan and superior and green bay this route followed the modern us 2 from ironwood to the m 94 junction in manistique using the modern m 69 and m 95 to stay in michigan branches of the route followed us 41 and m 35 between powers and escanaba the route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around lake michigan the name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of world war i
one canadian auto trail was routed through the up as well in 1920 the king s international highway linked vancouver british columbia to halifax nova scotia but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of lake superior motorists had to ship their cars by boat between sault ste marie ontario and thunder bay or enter the united states to continue along the auto trail the routings varied on the maps of the time but its basic route used us 2 through the up from ironwood to sault ste marie until a highway north of lake superior was opened in 1960 by that time the auto trail had taken on the trans canada highway name
state trunkline
the first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern us 2 was m 12 a designation that was in use by july 1 1919 between ironwood and sault ste marie the first roadside park in the country was created by herbert larson near what is now us 2 near iron river in 1919 20 although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside us 16 grand river avenue in 1929 south of saranac when the us highway system was created on november 11 1926 us 2 partially replaced m 12 between crystal falls and iron mountain us 2 was routed through florence wisconsin the former routing of m 12 from crystal falls to sagola became a new m 69 when the former m 69 became us 102 now us 141 m 12 from sagola south to iron mountain was made a part of an extended m 45 which is now m 95 by the next year m 48 was added along us 2 from rexton to garnet as part of a larger extension
the first changes to the routing of us 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown escanaba a larger rerouting was completed in 1933 between rogers park and sault ste marie the new routing followed mackinac trail instead of turning east to cedarville and north to sault ste marie the former routing was given the m 121 designation another realignment in the iron mountain area shifted us 2 us 141 to a new bridge over the menominee river between 1932 and 1934 downtown ironwood was bypassed in 1934 and the former route was initially designated m 54
the michigan state highway department mshd changed the routings and designations of the highways around cooks thompson and manistique in the mid 1930s the agency rerouted us 2 between cooks and m 149 in thompson turning the old road back to county control the section between m 149 and m 125 was redesignated as an extension of m 149 to thompson and m 125 was replaced by a further extension of m 149 the last change was to route us 2 along its current alignment in the area completing the changes on august 2 1936
the mshd started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted us 2 into st ignace for the first time between brevort and moran us 2 previously followed worth road inland to the tahquamenon trail to meet the northern extension of us 31 into the upper peninsula the new routing took us 2 along the lakeshore into st ignace us 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in mackinaw city and us 2 was routed through st ignace along the former us 31 to rogers park the connection in st ignace to the state ferry docks became m 122 further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near watersmeet and crystal falls
additional realignments were completed by the mshd to move us 2 to its modern lakeshore routing between gould city and epoufette in 1941 the new highway traveled due east from gould city to naubinway and then along the lake to epoufette the former route through engadine was turned back to local control as far east as garnet from there east it was numbered just m 48 removing us 2 from a concurrency another former section into epoufette was added to extend m 117 the new highway was detoured around the cut river bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during world war ii
the western end of us 2 took on two changes in the 1940s m 28 was extended along us 2 to the state line at ironwood from its western terminus at wakefield a similar extension was made from m 28 s eastern terminus to sault ste marie in 1948 the m 54 designation was renumbered as business us 2 by 1945 the eastern m 28 extension was reversed in 1950 and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952
interstate era
with the coming of the interstate highway system in michigan the mshd planned to convert the eastern section of us 2 to a freeway between st ignace and sault st marie in planning maps from 1947 this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the interstates it was also included in the general location of national system of interstate highways including all additional routes at urban areas designated in september 1955 or yellow book after the cover color that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system the proposed number in 1958 was interstate 75 i 75
the first section of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between evergreen shores and m 123 north of st ignace the mackinac bridge was opened to traffic on november 1 1957 a new section of freeway and an interchange connected us 2 to the bridge in 1961 another new freeway segment closed the gap between the mackinac bridge and evergreen shores sections at the time the i 75 designation supplanted us 27 on the bridge and us 2 was shifted to follow i 75 along the freeways in the st ignace area the former routing of us 2 in downtown st ignace was redesignated bl i 75 more sections of freeway were opened in 1962 immediately to the south of the newly constructed international bridge in sault ste marie as well as between dafter and kinross the last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at m 123 to kinross and the section between dafter and sault ste marie at this time all of us 2 s former routing became a county road known as mackinac trail h 63
the department of state highways expanded us 2 us 41 into an expressway between gladstone and rapid river in 1971 the state built a new bridge over the manistique river in 1983 bypassing downtown mdot disposed of the former routing of us 2 into downtown in two ways the western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control an extension of m 94 replaced the remainder including the siphon bridge through downtown in that same year the department truncated us 2 to end in st ignace by removing it from the i 75 freeway the last changes were made to us 2 s routing through iron river in 1998 bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town in 2011 mdot raised the speed limit along the expressway section in delta county from 55 to 65 mph 89 to 105 km h although the speed limit for trucks remains 55 mph 89 km h
memorial designations and tourist routes
on july 1 1924 the state administrative board named m 12 the predecessor to us 2 in michigan the bohn highway to honor frank p bohn a prominent local citizen who later served in congress from 1927 to 1933 in 1929 the residents of escanaba created a memorial to the veterans of world war i called memory lane the project consisted of elm and maple trees planted along us 2 us 41 west of town the american legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers later in 1949 the bessemer women s club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans also called memory lane the group planted 140 elms and 1 840 evergreens trees and shrubs as a landscaped parkway along 2 3 miles 3 7 km of us 2 east of bessemer
most of us 2 along with us 23 in the lower peninsula was designated the united spanish war veterans memorial highway in 1949 to connect the gap in the routing where us 2 cuts through wisconsin m 95 and m 69 were used in place of us 2 between iron mountain and crystal falls signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when governor george w romney had them installed
the amvets memorial drive designation was created for the section of us 2 us 41 m 35 between the northern escanaba city limits and county road 426 cr 426 in delta county the american veterans amvets organization in michigan petitioned the michigan legislature to grant this designation which was assigned under public act 144 in 1959
two sections of us 2 are part of the overall great lakes circle tour glct the segment from the wisconsin state line near ironwood to the m 28 junction in wakefield is part of the lake superior circle tour lsct and the segment from the southern m 35 junction in escanaba to the eastern terminus in st ignace is part of the lake michigan circle tour lmct these two tours were created in may 1986 through a joint effort between mdot and its counterparts in wisconsin minnesota and ontario the section of us 2 between iron river and crystal falls has been named the iron county heritage trail this pure michigan byway was designated to honor the rich history of two industries that built a state and nation mining and logging on august 26 2007 mdot announced that the section of us 2 that runs concurrently with m 35 in delta county was being included in the up hidden coast recreational heritage trail
historic bridges
there are six bridges along current or former sections of us 2 that mdot has added to its listing of michigan s historic bridges two of these are also listed on the national register of historic places nrhp a third bridge added to the nrhp in late 2012 has not been added to mdot s listing however the first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the iron river which has since been bypassed by a new bridge the original structure dating to 1918 is a 55 foot long 17 m spandrel arch span that was built by the mshd as trunk line bridge no 191 the structure was listed on the nrhp on december 9 1999 for its architectural and engineering significance
in december 2012 the national park service approved the listing of the upper twin falls bridge that crosses the menominee river northwest of iron mountain the structure is a single span pin connected camelback through truss bridge and it is the only known example of its type in michigan it was built between 1909 and 1910 because the twin falls power dam would flood an existing river crossing the span cost 5 106 equivalent to 780 000 in 2015 paid equally by dickinson and florence counties until the 1930s the upper twin falls bridge carried us 2 across the menominee river in 1934 a new bridge was built about a mile downstream and the highway was rerouted over the new span the bridge closed to automobile traffic in september 1971 and the nomination process for inclusion on the national register of historic places began in 2012
in 2003 mdot replaced the sturgeon river bridge in waucedah township dickinson county as of october 2011 even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced mdot retained it on their historic bridge list it was built in 1929
before 1983 us 2 used a different routing through manistique and crossed the manistique river on what is nicknamed the siphon bridge built as a part of a raceway flume on the river the water level is actually higher than the road surface this produces a siphon effect giving the bridge its nickname the manistique pulp and paper company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the manistique river to supply their mill this dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction instead of expensive dikes a concrete tank was built lengthwise in the river bed the sides of this tank provided man made banks higher than the natural banks the michigan works progress administration described the bridge as having concrete bulkheads formed by the side spans of the bridge that allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed the manistique tourism council stated at one time the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was atmospherically forced under it and that the bridge has been featured in ripley s believe it or not the eight span structure is 294 feet 90 m long
the cut river bridge carries us 2 across the cut river in hendricks township mackinac county this structure was built during world war ii but completion was delayed due to war induced steel shortages the span uses 888 short tons 793 long tons 806 t of structural steel to bridge the 641 feet 195 m over the river and its gorge at a height of 147 feet 45 m above the river the cut river bridge is one of only two cantilevered deck truss bridges in the state on either side of the bridge there are picnic areas and trails down to the river
listed on the nrhp on december 17 1999 the mackinac trail carp river bridge carries h 63 the modern successor to us 2 over the carp river north of st ignace the bridge is another spandrel arch structure 60 feet 18 m in length and built in 1920 increasing traffic along mackinac trail prompted the mshd to widen its deck by five feet 1 5 m and install new guardrails in the 1929 1930 biennium along with the addition of decorative retaining walls
the last of the historic bridges along a former segment of us 2 is the structure carrying ashmun street bs i 75 over the power canal in sault ste marie built in 1934 it is one of only three steel arch bridges in the state the 42 foot wide 13 m and 257 foot long 78 m structure is described by mdot as massive with an innovative construction method the previous structure was used as a falsework for the current bridge before removal
major intersections
mdot has erected milemarkers along the two michigan segments of the highway that use the total mileage starting at the state line in ironwood the signs on the eastern segment reflect the mileage in florence county wisconsin
business route
business u s highway 2 bus us 2 is a 1 270 mile 2 044 km business route that runs from the wisconsin state line at the montreal river the route extends through downtown ironwood on silver and aurora streets before turning northward along suffolk street bus us 2 stays on suffolk street for a short while until it turns onto frederick street on frederick street bus us 2 bears north through a residential area along douglas street the eastern terminus of the route is at its junction with us 2 at the corner of cloverland drive and douglas street north of downtown
the business route was created in august 1942 when former m 54 in ironwood was renumbered as a business loop of us 2 it was originally a bi state business connection before the wisconsin department of transportation decommissioned bus us 2 in hurley westward along state trunk highway 77 and northward along us 51 in 2002

thelnetham windmill
thelnetham windmill also known as button s mill is a grade ii listed tower mill constructed of brick the windmill is located at thelnetham suffolk england it was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into flour thelnetham windmill worked by wind power until 1924 latterly on two sails after which it became derelict
in 1979 a group of enthusiasts purchased thelnetham windmill for restoration numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight year period the mill is open to the public and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site
the mill is a small four storey tower mill with patent sails and winded by a fantail it drives two pairs of millstones with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine
history
the windmill at thelnetham was built by millwright george bloomfield for william button in 1819 it replaced a post mill which had been moved to sandy lane diss norfolk the previous year the mill was set to work on christmas day 1819 in 1832 the mill was modernised by the fitting of a cast iron windshaft patent sails and a fantail the new windshaft was fitted on 16 july 1832 it was made by j aickman the kings lynn millwright and weighs 1 tons 1 780 kg a new stock was fitted in september 1836 william button died on 11 february 1837 the mill passed jointly to his widow rebecca and their son richard richard button worked the mill until 1860 at which date it was conveyed to his sons richard and william who sold it to richard peverett from kenninghall norfolk in 1862
the mill was worked by stephen peverett richard s son he inherited the mill on the death of his father in 1875 and leased it to henry bryant in 1879 in 1884 the mill was sold by auction and henry bryant purchased the freehold bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill from 1892 a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power driving an extra pair of millstones on the ground floor this was replaced in 1914 by a hornsby oil engine bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to alphonso vincent a retired millwright from garboldisham norfolk the hornsby engine was sold in the early 1920s the mill was tailwinded c1920 and as a result one pair of sails was removed vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924 one of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again tailwinded
on the death of alphonso vincent in 1932 his son george inherited the property he lived at the site in an old lorry until his death in 1973 the mill passed to his daughter who sold it in 1974 to mr and mrs humphries who intended to convert it into a house they later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration in 1976 the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the suffolk mills group in november 1979 and plans for restoration were made the consortium consisted of mark barnard charles dolman peter dolman david pearce and chris seago the derelict mill and an acre of land cost 6 000
restoration
the mill was restored over a period of six years much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill
1979 1980
the consortium took possession of the mill in november 1979 the first priority was to make the mill as weathertight as possible polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure the mill was surveyed and recorded in spring 1980 the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame
a two week work in was held at the end of july and beginning of august 1980 thirty three volunteers worked on the mill over the work in two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at bury st edmunds on 3 august 1980 the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane followed by the cap frame and the cast iron curb sections
new oak joists were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower the bin floor was removed apart from one oak main beam which was repairable a replacement main beam was made from pitch pine and the oak beam was repaired new oak joists were fitted along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused one of these had previously been a whip from a common sail some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the eastbridge windpump which following its collapse on 19 february 1977 had been re erected at the museum of east anglian life stowmarket the sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair brickwork was repaired and new lintels were made for some of the windows a tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter the floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed
the work was financed by grants of 500 from the council for the preservation of rural essex 250 from st edmundsbury borough council 200 from the scarfe trust and 200 from the suffolk mills group other donations and income amounted to 65 with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the five owners
the work in was reported in both local and national media including bbc look east bury free press eastern daily press east anglian daily times daily telegraph and radio orwell
1981
in the 1981 season two separate work ins were held the first from 25 july to 2 august and the second from 22 august to 30 august a total of 37 volunteers participated over the two weeks
the millstones were removed from the stone floor which was then repaired one of the main beams was found to have been attacked by death watch beetles and over a third of the elm beam was replaced with oak the six supports for the hurst frame were repaired one at a time as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above one post required replacement it had rotted and the floor had sunk by 4 inches 100 mm causing the second main floor beam to fracture when this work had been completed the stone floor was removed including the second main floor beam which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed
the new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was concreted the stone floor was reconstructed reusing the old stone bearers and those joists that were fit for reuse other joists were made new from oak or pitch pine new floorboards were laid in the dust floor the 1 1 4 inches 32 mm thick elm boards being double grooved with a metal tongue between them those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration the top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them aided by a trammel attached to the upright shaft
during the second work in the remainder of the stone floor was boarded again using double grooved boards with a metal tongue between them the window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued the top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks the dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted the windshaft the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint a new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak 3 feet 910 mm long by 16 inches 410 mm diameter a start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar
after the work in had finished the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn the work done in 1981 cost 3 250 donations received were 2 000 from rank xerox 1 704 from the historic buildings council and 130 from st edmundsbury borough council other donations and income received amounted to 70 the project received further coverage in local media the eastern daily press and south norfolk news
1982
the 1982 work ins took place from 24 july to 1 august and 21 august to 29 august the work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower installation of the elm curb a start on the construction of the new cap installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows the cap frame was constructed incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused the cap frame was completed in autumn 1982 it had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position
1983
work in the early part of 1983 was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various brasses and overhaul of the various parts of the fantail drivetrain and mechanism for controlling the patent sails the mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits including one from the wind and watermill section of the society for the protection of ancient buildings other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the 4 feet 7 inches 1 40 m stones including dismantling the stone nut and replacement of three cogs in beech
when the weather improved work commenced outside the cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work in commenced the work ins took place over two separate weeks in july and august with 35 people participating during the first work in the fantail posts and braces were fitted the oak cap ribs which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass the cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings the rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time
between the two work ins the rear dormer was completed and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed this enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the monday of the second work in the boards for the cap are inch 13 mm thick and 9 inches 230 mm wide at the petticoat tapering towards the top a new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit when the boarding of the cap was completed the cover strips were fitted over the joints the petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass and the galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position producing a sturdy structure the striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts at the top of the mill tower the curb was prepared to accept the cap and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position repointing of the brickwork of the tower continued with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work in
after the work ins had ended work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift on in october the weather hampered the work initially but the application of a modern microporous paint designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof was completed in time for the lift on a mini work in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted with 17 people participating over the weekend final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill the tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled the 5 ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 october 1983 watched by a crowd of some 70 people the fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from adnams brewery southwold
restoration work in 1983 cost 1 408 grants were received from the association of independent museums blo norton women s institute ipswich historical transport society the national association for gifted children mr d porter and the society for the protection of ancient buildings further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by wilf foreman
1984
four work ins were held during 1984 the first two were by apprentices from eastern electricity board thelnetham windmill was chosen at the project to benefit from the young person s development project for that year pakenham watermill had previously benefited from the project and its owners the suffolk preservation trust had suggested that thelnetham windmill would be a good candidate for the scheme two separate parties spent a week each at the mill a mains electricity supply was provided an underground cable was laid with assistance from british telecom who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their research facility at martlesham heath the thrust borer laid 25 yards 23 m of ducting through which the mains cable was pulled into position the mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor
other work undertaken by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position a concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture leading to rising damp a french drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem a 21 horsepower 16 kw ruston hornsby 4yhr diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane after fitting it was then painted some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary
off site the new brake wheel and fantail were made the original brake wheel was too rotten to repair and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819 the original brake wheel was 6 feet 1 83 m diameter to allow the common sails to run at their optimum speed when the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill as patent sails run at a slower speed than common sails the great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter the brake wheel was also rebuilt with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs resulting in a wheel 7 feet 2 inches 2 18 m in diameter the opinion of professional millwrights was sought and it was decided that a scaled up version of the original brake wheel would be made but retaining the cast iron teeth segments the remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill the original iron segments were all broken so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat treated malleable cast iron when the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly
the fantail was made some of the small gears were replaced the stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from douglas fir work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows with only one window still needing attention when the first work in began new beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft
the stocks and sails were made during the two work ins held in july and august a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks a second hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use thus two new stocks were required instead of one modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds leaving two options traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber or laminated stocks good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds a douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made
the 52 feet 15 85 m long stocks were made from douglas fir all timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned it was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to 20 stronger than a similar stock of solid timber the timber used was 1 1 2 inches 38 mm thick and nine laminations were required at the centre where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber both stocks were made during the work in with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use the stocks were the first laminated stocks made by amateurs
the four sails were made the originals being slightly different pairs those on the inner stock having bays of 3 feet 910 mm pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of 3 feet 2 inches 970 mm pitch it was decided that the new sails would be identical at the larger pitch four 27 feet 8 23 m long whips were cut from a baulk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished maltings at bury st edmunds the whips are 6 inches 150 mm square at their inner end sail bars and uplongs were made from modern pitch pine selected for quality the mortices for the sail bars were cut that at the heel of the sail being at 27 and that at the tip being 15 decreasing by 1 at each sail bar three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in
the fantail and associated gearing was fitted to the mill at the end of the second work in the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank the fantail itself with the blades painted red white and blue was installed shortly afterwards the clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft it was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by inch 13 mm when this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1 16 th of an inch less than 1 mm of true the clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork the four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work in the stock with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock the process was repeated for the second pair of sails the mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work in
work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail gearing the brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast
restoration work in 1984 cost 2 918 grants received were 1 209 from english heritage 500 from st edmundsbury borough council other donations amounted to 52 income from open days at the mill came to 151 a boost to the funds was 2 000 from hervey benham this money had been allocated to allow the moving of a derelict post mill buck to thelnetham in the end the removal was not proceeded with and mr benham allowed the donation to remain with the thelnetham mill preservation trust the project received further support in local media including the east anglian daily times one of the work ins being featured on anglia television s about anglia programme
1985 87
work planned for 1985 included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails the external walls of the mill were tarred and internal walls plastered two work ins were held from 20 july to 28 july and 17 august to 26 august further work over the next two years saw the restoration completed in 1987
restoration team
the restoration of thelnetham windmill was made possible by the efforts of 135 individuals and 61 organisations this was achieved by the donation of labour plant materials or grants of money or by giving discounts for materials purchased or providing publicity for the project

production
sailor mouth was directed by andrew overtoom and was written by walt dohrn paul tibbitt and merriwether williams dohrn and tibbitt also served as storyboard directors and carson kugler william reiss and erik wiese worked as storyboard artists series creator stephen hillenburg has described the episode plot as a classic thing all kids go through much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers own experiences from childhood the episode originally aired on nickelodeon in the united states on september 21 2001 the episode marks the introduction of mr krabs mother mama krabs who was voiced by former spongebob squarepants creative producer and current executive producer paul tibbitt
the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode the idea for sailor mouth was inspired by creative director derek drymon s experience when i got in trouble for saying the f word in front of my mother drymon said the scene where patrick is running to mr krabs to tattle with spongebob chasing him is pretty much how it happened in real life the end of the episode where mr krabs uses more profanity than spongebob and patrick was also inspired by the fact that my drymon s mother has a sailor mouth herself
the scene where spongebob and patrick playing a game of eels and escalators which is a parody of snakes and ladders was difficult for the crew to animate since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location according to the series season 2 dvd commentary it was planned to have a scene that had spongebob saying go dolphin noise yourself followed by patrick saying dolphin noise you too during the eels and escalators game it was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience
sailor mouth was released on the dvd compilation called spongebob squarepants sea stories on march 12 2002 it was also included in the spongebob squarepants the complete 2nd season dvd released on october 19 2004 on september 22 2009 sailor mouth was released on the spongebob squarepants the first 100 episodes alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five
reception

according to a report titled wolves in sheep s clothing which documents the increase in potentially violent profane and sexual content in children s programming the parents television council a watchdog media group and fans believed the spongebob squarepants episode sailor mouth was an implicit attempt to promote and satirize use of profanity among children the episode originally aired during the 2001 02 television season ironically the season in which the ptc named spongebob squarepants among the best programs on cable television but the report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use of profanity among children in a later report several members of the ptc listed sailor mouth as an example of how levels of profane sexual and violent activity has increased in children s television programming nickelodeon in response to the incident said it s sad and a little desperate that they stooped to literally putting profane language in the mouths of our characters to make a point has the fcc looked at this richard huff of the new york daily news criticized the report for misinterpreting an episode of spongebob squarepants sailor mouth over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly
military history of australia
the military history of australia spans the nation s 220 year modern history from the early australian frontier wars between aboriginals and europeans to the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan in the early 21st century although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars and war and military service have been significant influences on australian society and national identity including the anzac spirit the relationship between war and australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma
as british offshoots the australian colonies participated in britain s small wars of the 19th century while later as a federated dominion and then an independent nation australia fought in the first world war and second world war as well as in the wars in korea malaya borneo and vietnam during the cold war in the post vietnam era australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions through the united nations and other agencies including in the sinai persian gulf rwanda somalia east timor and the solomon islands while more recently they have also fought as part of multi lateral forces in iraq and afghanistan in total nearly 103 000 australians died during the course of these conflicts
war and australian society
for most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white australian males and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century it continues to influence australian society to this day war and military service have been defining influences in australian history while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the australian experience of war and of soldiering known as the anzac spirit these ideals include notions of endurance courage ingenuity humour larrikinism egalitarianism and mateship traits which according to popular thought defined the behaviour of australian soldiers fighting at gallipoli during the first world war the gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw australians taking part as australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity
the relationship between war and australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of australian strategic culture bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare indeed australian defence policy was closely linked to britain until the japanese crisis of 1942 while since then an alliance with the united states has underwritten its security arguably this pattern of bandwagoning both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs as well as for more pragmatic security concerns has ensured that australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies regardless a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident with australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges
reflecting both the realist and liberal paradigms of international relations and the conception of national interests a number of other important themes in australian strategic culture are also obvious such themes include an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics the centrality of notions of westphalian sovereignty a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security and the proposition that the status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully likewise multilateralism collective security and defence self reliance have also been important themes change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history being the product of australian society s democratic political tradition and judaeo christian anglo european heritage as well its associated values beliefs and economic political and religious ideology these behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely european island on the edge of the asia pacific and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power to be sure during threats to the core australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result it has frequently become involved in foreign wars throughout these conflicts australian soldiers known colloquially as diggers have often been noted somewhat paradoxically for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities
colonial era
british forces in australia 1788 1870
from 1788 until 1870 the defence of the australian colonies was mostly provided by british army regular forces originally marines protected the early settlements at sydney cove and norfolk island however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a british army unit specifically recruited for colonial service known as the new south wales corps the new south wales corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of irish convicts at castle hill in 1804 soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the war office of the need for a more reliable garrison in new south wales and van diemen s land chief of these shortcomings was the rum rebellion a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 as a result in january 1810 the 73rd perthshire regiment of foot arrived in australia by 1870 25 british infantry regiments had served in australia as had a small number of artillery and engineer units
although the primary role of the british army was to protect the colonies against external attack no actual threat ever materialised the british army was instead used in policing guarding convicts at penal institutions combating bushranging putting down convict rebellions as occurred at bathurst in 1830 and to suppress aboriginal resistance to the extension of european settlement notably british soldiers were involved in the battle at the eureka stockade in 1854 on the victorian goldfields members of british regiments stationed in australia also saw action in india afghanistan new zealand and the sudan
during the early years of settlement the naval defence of australia was provided by detached royal navy units of the east indies station based in sydney however in 1859 australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore marking the first occasion that royal navy ships had been permanently stationed in australia the royal navy remained the primary naval force in australian waters until 1913 when the australia station ceased and responsibility handed over to the royal australian navy the royal navy s depots dockyards and structures were given to the australian people
frontier warfare 1788 1934
the reactions of the native aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of british settlers in australia were varied but were inevitably hostile when the settler s presence led to competition over resources and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants lands european diseases decimated aboriginal populations and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation by and large neither the british nor the aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare at times however the frontier wars did see the involvement of british soldiers and later mounted police units not all aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands while many aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes
fighting between aborigines and europeans was localised as the aborigines did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance as a result there was not a single war but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent organised or disorganised however a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century this warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic myth of peaceful settlement in australia faced with aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres among the most famous is the battle of pinjarra in western australia in 1834 such incidents were not officially sanctioned however and after the myall creek massacre in new south wales in 1838 seven europeans were hanged for their part in the killings however in tasmania the so called black war was fought between 1828 and 1832 and aimed at driving most of the island s native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas although it began in failure for the british it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population
it may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by europeans on aborigines although many more aborigines died than british this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the europeans aboriginal tactics varied but were mainly based on pre existing hunting and fighting practices using spears clubs and other primitive weapons unlike the indigenous peoples of new zealand and north america on the main aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the europeans although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms this was not widespread the aborigines were never a serious military threat to european settlers regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them on occasions large groups of aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued during which the aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage this could sometimes be effective with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded however such open warfare usually proved more costly for the aborigines than the europeans
central to the success of the europeans was the use of firearms however the advantages afforded by firearms have often been overstated prior to the late 19th century firearms were often cumbersome muzzle loading smooth bore single shot muskets with flint lock mechanisms such weapons produced a low rate of fire while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within 50 metres 160 ft these deficiencies may have initially given the aborigines an advantage allowing them to move in close and engage with spears or clubs yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the europeans a distinct advantage with the six shot colt revolver the snider single shot breech loading rifle and later the martini henry rifle as well as rapid fire rifles such as the winchester rifle becoming available these weapons when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of aborigines often proved successful the europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast moving often hidden enemies tactics employed included night time surprise attacks and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks
the conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of british settlement in australia beginning in new south wales with the arrival of the first europeans in may 1788 it continued in sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s as the frontier moved west so did the conflict pushing into outback new south wales in the 1840s in tasmania fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s while in victoria and the southern parts of south australia the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s the south west of western australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850 the war in queensland began in the area around brisbane in the 1840s and continued until 1860 moving to central queensland in the 1850s and 1860s and then to northern queensland from the 1860s to 1900 in western australia the violence moved north with european settlement reaching the kimberley region by 1880 with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s in the northern territory conflict lasted even later still especially in central australia continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s one estimate of casualties places european deaths at 2 500 while at least 20 000 aborigines are believed to have perished far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist
new zealand wars 1861 64
taranaki war
in 1861 the victorian ship hmcss victoria was dispatched to help the new zealand colonial government in its war against m ori in taranaki victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support although a number of personnel were involved in actions against m ori fortifications one sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment
invasion of the waikato
in late 1863 the new zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the waikato province against the m ori promised settlement on confiscated land more than 2 500 australians over half of whom were from victoria were recruited to form four waikato regiments other australians became scouts in the company of forest rangers despite experiencing arduous conditions the australians were not heavily involved in battle and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties australians were involved in actions at matarikoriko pukekohe east titi hill r kau and te ranga fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action the conflict was over by 1864 and the waikato regiments disbanded in 1867 however many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade while many others had returned to australia
colonial military forces 1870 1901
from 1870 until 1901 each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence the colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 and while the colonial office in london retained control of some affairs the governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia to do this they were granted the authority from the british crown to raise military and naval forces initially these were militias in support of british regulars but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870 the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities the colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia paid citizen soldiers and a small permanent component they were mainly infantry cavalry and mounted infantry and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline even after significant reforms in the 1870s including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense by 1885 the forces numbered 21 000 men although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the british empire during the 19th century with the colonies raising contingents to serve in sudan south africa and china
despite a reputation of colonial inferiority many of the locally raised units were highly organised disciplined professional and well trained during this period defences in australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery based on garrisoned coastal forts however by the 1890s improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led major general james edwards who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry as a consequence he called for a restructure of defences and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies edwards argued for the colonial forces to be federated and for professional units obliged to serve anywhere in the south pacific to replace the volunteer forces these views found support in the influential new south wales commandant major general edward hutton however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards new south wales and victoria stifled the proposal these reforms remaining unresolved however and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies
with the exception of western australia the colonies also operated their own navies in 1856 victoria received its own naval vessel hmcss victoria and its deployment to new zealand in 1860 during the first taranaki war marked the first occasion that an australian warship had been deployed overseas the colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo boats for the defence of harbours and rivers as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies with the ironclad hmvs cerberus in service from 1870 as well as the steam sail warship hms nelson on loan from the royal navy three small gunboats and five torpedo boats new south wales formed a naval brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo boats and a corvette the queensland maritime defence force was established in 1885 while south australia operated a single ship hmcs protector tasmania had also a small torpedo corps while western australia s only naval defences included the fremantle naval artillery naval personnel from new south wales and victoria took part in the suppression of the boxer rebellion in china in 1900 while hmcs protector was sent by south australia but saw no action the separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until federation in 1901 when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new commonwealth of australia
sudan 1885
during the early years of the 1880s an egyptian regime in the sudan backed by the british came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native muhammad ahmad or ahmed known as mahdi to his followers in 1883 as part of the mahdist war the egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces the british instructed the egyptians to abandon the sudan and sent general charles gordon to co ordinate the evacuation but he was killed in january 1885 when news of his death arrived in new south wales in february 1885 the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent s expenses the new south wales contingent consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from sydney on 3 march 1885
the contingent arrived in suakin on 29 march and were attached to a brigade that consisted of scots grenadier and coldstream guards they subsequently marched for tamai in a large square formation made up of 10 000 men reaching the village they burned huts and returned to suakin three australians were wounded in minor fighting most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards berber on the nile the australians were then assigned to guard duties but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered they rode on a reconnaissance to takdul on 6 may and were heavily involved in a skirmish during which more than 100 arabs were killed or captured on 15 may they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous march meanwhile the artillery were posted at handoub and drilled for a month but they soon rejoined the camp at suakin
eventually the british government decided that the campaign in sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in suakin the new south wales contingent sailed for home on 17 may arriving in sydney on 19 june 1885 approximately 770 australians served in sudan nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign
second boer war 1899 1902
british encroachment into areas of south africa already settled by the afrikaner boers and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result led to the second boer war in 1899 pre empting the deployment of british forces the afrikaner republics of the orange free state and the transvaal republic under president paul kruger declared war on 11 october 1899 striking deep into the british territories of natal and the cape colony after the outbreak of war plans for the dispatch of a combined australian force were subsequently set aside by the british war office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate contingents to serve with british formations with two squadrons each of 125 men from new south wales and victoria and one each from the other colonies the first troops arrived three weeks later with the new south wales lancers who had been training in england before the war hurriedly diverted to south africa on 22 november the lancers came under fire for the first time near belmont and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them
following a series of minor victories the british suffered a major setback during black week between 10 17 december 1899 although no australian units were involved the first contingents of infantry from victoria south australia western australia and tasmania arrived in cape town on 26 november and were designated the australian regiment under the command of colonel john charles hoad with a need for increased mobility they were soon converted into mounted infantry further units from queensland and new south wales arrived in december and were soon committed to the front the first casualties occurred soon after at sunnyside on 1 january 1900 after 250 queensland mounted infantry and a column of canadians british and artillery attacked a boer laager at belmont troopers david mcleod and victor jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the boer forward sentries regardless the boers were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner five hundred queenslanders and the new south wales lancers subsequently took part in the siege of kimberley in february 1900
despite serious set backs at colenso stormberg magersfontein and spion kop in january and with ladysmith still under siege the british mounted a five division counter invasion of the orange free state in february the attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by lieutenant general john french with the new south wales lancers queensland mounted infantry and new south wales army medical corps attached first kimberley was relieved following the battles of modder river and magersfontein and the retreating boers defeated at paardeberg with the new south wales mounted rifles locating the boer general piet cronj the british entered bloemfontein on 13 march 1900 while ladysmith was relieved disease began to take its toll and scores of men died still the advance continued with the drive to pretoria in may including more than 3 000 australians johannesburg fell on 30 may and the boers withdrew from pretoria on 3 june the new south wales mounted rifles and western australians saw action again at diamond hill on 12 june mafeking was relieved on 17 may
following the defeat of the afrikaner republics still the boers held out forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt british troop movements and lines of supply this new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the australian colonies and the raising of the bushmen s contingents with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse riding and shooting skills but little military experience after federation in 1901 eight australian commonwealth horse battalions of the newly created australian army were also sent to south africa although they saw little fighting before the war ended some australians later joined local south african irregular units instead of returning home after discharge these soldiers were part of the british army and were subject to british military discipline such units included the bushveldt carbineers which gained notoriety as the unit in which harry breaker morant and peter handcock served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes
with the guerrillas requiring supplies koos de la rey lead a force of 3 000 boers against brakfontein on the elands river in western transvaal the post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 australians and 200 rhodesians the attack began on 4 august 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties during the night the defenders dug in enduring shelling and rifle fire a relief force was stopped by the boers while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved the siege lasted 11 days during which more than 1 800 shells were fired into the post after calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders and not prepared to risk a frontal attack the boers eventually retired the siege of elands river was one of the major achievements of the australians during the war with the post finally relieved on 16 august
in response the british adopted counter insurgency tactics including a scorched earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops the establishment of concentration camps for boer women and children and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit boer mobility and to protect railway communications such measures required considerable expenditure and caused much bitterness towards the british however they soon yielded results by mid 1901 the bulk of the fighting was over and british mounted units would ride at night to attack boer farmhouses or encampments overwhelming them with superior numbers indicative of warfare in last months of 1901 the new south wales mounted rifles travelled 1 814 miles 2 919 km and were involved in 13 skirmishes killing 27 boers wounding 15 and capturing 196 for the loss of five dead and 19 wounded other notable australian actions included slingersfontein pink hill rhenosterkop and haartebeestefontein
australians were not always successful however suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war on 12 june 1901 the 5th victorian mounted rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at wilmansrust near middleburg after poor security allowed a force of 150 boers to surprise them on 30 october 1901 victorians of the scottish horse regiment also suffered heavy casualties at gun hill although 60 boers were also killed in the engagement meanwhile at onverwacht on 4 january 1902 the 5th queensland imperial bushmen lost 13 killed and 17 wounded ultimately the boers were defeated and the war ended on 31 may 1902 in all 16 175 australians served in south africa and perhaps another 10 000 enlisted as individuals in imperial units casualties included 251 killed in action 267 died of disease and 43 missing in action while a further 735 were wounded six australians were awarded the victoria cross
boxer rebellion 1900 01
the boxer rebellion in china began in 1900 and a number of western nations including many european powers the united states and japan soon sent forces as part of the china field force to protect their interests in june the british government sought permission from the australian colonies to dispatch ships from the australian squadron to china the colonies also offered to assist further but as most of their troops were still engaged in south africa they had to rely on naval forces for manpower the force dispatched was a modest one with britain accepting 200 men from victoria 260 from new south wales and the south australian ship hmcs protector under the command of captain william creswell most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role amongst the naval contingent from new south wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at victoria barracks sydney who originally enlisted for the second boer war the soldiers were keen to go to china but refused to be enlisted as sailors while the new south wales naval brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks the army and navy compromised and titled the contingent the nsw marine light infantry
the contingents from new south wales and victoria sailed for china on 8 august 1900 arriving in tientsin the australians provided 300 men to an 8 000 strong multinational force tasked with capturing the chinese forts at pei tang which dominated a key railway they arrived too late to take part in the battle but were involved in the attack on the fortress at pao ting fu where the chinese government was believed to have found asylum after peking was captured by western forces the victorians joined a force of 7 500 men on a ten day march to the fort once again only to find that it had already surrendered the victorians then garrisoned tientsin and the new south wales contingent undertook garrison duties in peking hmcs protector was mostly used for survey transport and courier duties in the gulf of chihli before departing in november the naval brigades remained during the winter unhappily performing policing and guard duties as well as working as railwaymen and fire fighters they left china in march 1901 having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order six australians died from sickness and injury but none were killed as a result of enemy action
australian military forces at federation 1901
the commonwealth of australia came into existence on 1 january 1901 as a result of the federation of the australian colonies under the constitution of australia defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government the co ordination of australia wide defensive efforts in the face of imperial german interest in the pacific ocean was one of driving forces behind federalism and the department of defence immediately came into being as a result while the commonwealth military forces early forerunner of the australian army and commonwealth naval force were also soon established
the australian commonwealth military forces came into being on 1 march 1901 and all the colonial forces including those still in south africa became part of the new force 28 923 colonial soldiers including 1 457 professional soldiers 18 603 paid militia and 8 863 unpaid volunteers were subsequently transferred the individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial acts until the defence act 1903 brought all the units under one piece of legislation this act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside australia however the majority of soldiers remained in militia units known as the citizen military forces cmf major general sir edward hutton a former commander of the new south wales military forces subsequently became the first commander of the commonwealth military forces on 26 december and set to work devising an integrated structure for the new army in 1911 following a report by lord kitchener the royal military college duntroon was established as was a system of universal national service
prior to federation each self governing colony had operated its own naval force these navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities forcing the separate colonies to subsidise the cost of a british naval squadron in their waters for decades the colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 march 1901 when the commonwealth naval force was created this new force also lacked blue water capable ships and ultimately did not lead to a change in australian naval policy in 1907 prime minister alfred deakin and creswell while attending the imperial conference in london sought the british government s agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an australian navy the admiralty rejected and resented the challenge but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient deakin was unimpressed and in 1908 invited the american great white fleet to visit australia this visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 ton river class destroyers the surge in german naval construction prompted the admiralty to change their position however and the royal australian navy was subsequently formed in 1911 absorbing the commonwealth naval force on 4 october 1913 the new fleet steamed through sydney heads consisting of the battlecruiser hmas australia three light cruisers and three destroyers while several other ships were still under construction and as a consequence the navy entered the first world war as a formidable force
the australian flying corps afc was established as part of the commonwealth military forces in 1912 prior to the formation of the australian military forces in 1916 and was later separated in 1921 to form the royal australian air force making it the second oldest air force in the world regardless the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments
first world war 1914 18
outbreak of hostilities
when britain declared war on germany at the start of the first world war the australian government rapidly followed suit with prime minister joseph cook declaring on 5 august 1914 that when the empire is at war so also is australia and reflecting the sentiment of many australians that any declaration of war by britain automatically included australia this was itself in part due to the large number of british born citizens and first generation anglo australians that made up the australian population at the time indeed by the end of the war almost 20 of those who served in the australian forces had been born in britain
as the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the defence act 1903 an all volunteer expeditionary force known as the australian imperial force aif was formed and recruitment began on 10 august 1914 the government pledged 20 000 men organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units enlistment and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under mobilisation plans drawn up in 1912 the first commander was major general william bridges who also assumed command of the 1st division throughout the course of the conflict australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war although small air and naval forces were also committed
occupation of german new guinea
following the outbreak of war australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of germany s pacific colonies the australian naval and military expeditionary force an mef a 2000 man volunteer force separate from the aif and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval reservists and ex sailors was rapidly formed under the command of william holmes the objectives of the force were the wireless stations on nauru and those at yap in the caroline islands and at rabaul in german new guinea the force reached rabaul on 11 september 1914 and occupied it the next day encountering only brief resistance from the german and native defenders during fighting at bita paka and toma german new guinea surrendered on 17 september 1914 australian losses were light including six killed during the fighting but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine ae1 with all 35 men aboard
gallipoli
the aif departed by ship in a single convoy from albany on 1 november 1914 during the journey one of the convoy s naval escorts hmas sydney engaged and destroyed the german cruiser sms emden at the battle of cocos on 8 november in the first ship to ship action involving the royal australian navy although originally bound for england to undergo further training and then for employment on the western front the australians were instead sent to british controlled egypt to pre empt any turkish attack against the strategically important suez canal and with a view to opening another front against the central powers
aiming to knock turkey out of the war the british then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the australians were included amongst the british indian and french forces committed to the campaign the combined australian and new zealand army corps anzac commanded by british general william birdwood subsequently landed at anzac cove on the gallipoli peninsula on 25 april 1915 although promising to transform the war if successful the gallipoli campaign was ill conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate without achieving its objectives australian casualties totalled 26 111 including 8 141 killed
for australians and new zealanders the gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity today the date of the initial landings 25 april is known as anzac day in australia and new zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations as well as turkey to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original anzacs and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war

after the withdrawal from gallipoli the australians returned to egypt and the aif underwent a major expansion in 1916 the infantry began to move to france while the cavalry units remained in the middle east to fight the turks australian troops of the anzac mounted division and the australian mounted division saw action in all the major battles of the sinai and palestine campaign playing a pivotal role in fighting the turkish troops that were threatening british control of egypt the australian s first saw combat during the senussi uprising in the libyan desert and the nile valley during which the combined british forces successfully put down the primitive pro turkish islamic sect with heavy casualties the anzac mounted division subsequently saw considerable action in the battle of romani against the turkish between 3 5 august 1916 with the turks eventually pushed back following this victory the british forces went on the offensive in the sinai although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the suez canal rafa was captured on 9 january 1917 while the last of the small turkish garrisons in the sinai were eliminated in february
the advance entered palestine and an initial unsuccessful attempt was made to capture gaza on 26 march 1917 while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on 19 april a third assault occurred between 31 october and 7 november and this time both the anzac mounted division and the australian mounted division took part the battle was a complete success for the british over running the gaza beersheba line and capturing 12 000 turkish soldiers the critical moment was the capture of beersheba on the first day after the australian 4th light horse brigade charged more than 4 miles 6 4 km the turkish trenches were overrun with the australians capturing the wells at beersheeba and securing the valuable water they contained along with over 700 prisoners for the loss of 31 killed and 36 wounded later australian troops assisted in pushing the turkish forces out of palestine and took part in actions at mughar ridge jerusalem and the megiddo the turkish government surrendered on 30 october 1918 units of the light horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in egypt in 1919 and did so with efficiency and brutality although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process
meanwhile the afc had undergone remarkable development and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the dominions deploying just a single aircraft to german new guinea in 1914 the first operational flight did not occur until 27 may 1915 however when the mesopotamian half flight was called upon to assist in protecting british oil interests in iraq the afc was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in egypt palestine and on the western front where they performed well
western front
five infantry divisions of the aif saw action in france and belgium leaving egypt in march 1916 i anzac corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of armenti res on 7 april 1916 and for the next two and a half years the aif participated in most of the major battles on the western front earning a formidable reputation although spared from the disastrous first day of the battle of the somme within weeks four australian divisions had been committed the 5th division positioned on the left flank was the first in action during the battle of fromelles on 19 july 1916 suffering 5 533 casualties in a single day the 1st division entered the line on 23 july assaulting pozieres and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd division on 27 july they had suffered 5 286 casualties mouquet farm was attacked in august with casualties totalling 6 300 men by the time the aif was withdrawn from the somme to re organise they had suffered 23 000 casualties in just 45 days
in march 1917 the 2nd and 5th divisions pursued the germans back to the hindenburg line capturing the town of bapaume on 11 april the 4th division assaulted the hindenburg line in the disastrous first battle of bullecourt losing over 3 000 casualties and 1 170 captured on 15 april the 1st and 2nd divisions were counter attacked near lagnicourt and were forced to abandon the town before recapturing it again the 2nd division then took part in the second battle of bullecourt beginning on 3 may and succeeded in taking sections of the hindenburg line and holding them until relieved by the 1st division finally on 7 may the 5th division relieved the 1st remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid may combined these efforts cost 7 482 australian casualties
on 7 june 1917 the ii anzac corps along with two british corps launched an operation in flanders to eliminate a salient south of ypres the attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds 454 545 kg of explosives that had been placed underneath the messines ridge destroying the german trenches the advance was virtually unopposed and despite strong german counterattacks the next day it succeeded australian casualties during the battle of messines included nearly 6 800 men i anzac corps then took part in the third battle of ypres in belgium as part of the campaign to capture the gheluvelt plateau between september and november 1917 individual actions took place at menin road polygon wood broodseinde poelcappelle and passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the australians suffered 38 000 casualties
on 21 march 1918 the german army launched its spring offensive in a last ditched effort to win the war unleashing sixty three divisions over a 70 miles 110 km front as the allies fell back the 3rd and 4th divisions were rushed south to amiens on the somme the offensive lasted for the next five months and all five aif divisions in france were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide by late may the germans had pushed to within 50 miles 80 km of paris during this time the australians fought at dernacourt morlancourt villers bretonneux hangard wood hazebrouck and hamel at hamel the commander of the australian corps lieutenant general john monash successfully used combined arms including aircraft artillery and armour in an attack for the first time
the german offensive ground to a halt in mid july and a brief lull followed during which the australians undertook a series of raids known as peaceful penetrations the allies soon launched their own offensive the hundred days offensive ultimately ending the war beginning on 8 august 1918 the offensive included four australian divisions striking at amiens using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at hamel significant gains were made on what became known as the black day of the german army the offensive continued for four months and during second battle of the somme the australian corps fought actions at lihons etinehem proyart chuignes and mont st quentin before their final engagement of the war on 5 october 1918 at montbrehain the aif was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on 11 november 1918
in all 416 806 australians enlisted in the aif during the war and 333 000 served overseas 61 508 were killed and another 155 000 were wounded a total casualty rate of 65 the financial cost to the australian government was calculated at 376 993 052 two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war preserving the volunteer status of the australian force but stretching the reserves of manpower available particularly towards the end of the fighting consequently australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war
the war had a profound effect on australian society in other ways also indeed for many australians the nation s involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor while many of the notions of australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war 64 australians were awarded the victoria cross during the first world war
inter war years
russian civil war 1918 19
the russian civil war began after the russian provisional government collapsed and the bolshevik party assumed power in october 1917 following the end of the first world war the western powers including britain intervened giving half hearted support to the pro tsarist anti bolshevik white russian forces although the australian government refused to commit forces many australians serving with the british army became involved in the fighting a small number served as advisors to white russian units with the north russian expeditionary force nref awaiting repatriation in england about 150 australians subsequently enlisted in the british north russia relief force nrrf where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed
the royal australian navy destroyer hmas swan was also briefly engaged carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the black sea in late 1918 other australians served as advisers with the british military mission to the white russian general anton denikin in south russia while several more advised admiral aleksandr kolchak in siberia later they also served in mesopotamia as part of dunsterforce and the malleson mission although these missions were aimed at preventing turkish access to the middle east and india and did little fighting
although the motivations of those australian s that volunteered to fight in russia can only be guessed at it seems unlikely to have been political regardless they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage winning the only two victoria crosses of the land campaign despite their small numbers yet australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded with most deaths being from disease during operations in mesopotamia
malaita 1927
in october 1927 hmas adelaide was called to the british solomon islands protectorate as part of a punitive expedition in response to the killing of a district officer and sixteen others by kwaio natives at sinalagu on the island of malaita on 3 october known as the malaita massacre arriving at tulagi on 14 october the ship proceeded to malaita to protect the landing of three platoons of troops then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the killers the ship s personnel took no part in operations ashore providing only logistic and communications support adelaide returned to australia on 23 november
spanish civil war 1936 39
a small number of australian volunteers fought on both sides of the spanish civil war although they predominantly supported the spanish republic through the international brigades the australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other nationalities such as the british battalion and the lincoln battalion rather than forming their own units most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons while a number were spanish born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin at least 66 australians volunteered with only one nugent bull a conservative catholic who was later killed serving in the raf during the second world war known to have fought for general francisco franco s nationalist forces
while a celebrated cause for the australian left particularly the communist party of australia and the trade union movement the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality australian opposition to the republican cause was marshalled by b a santamaria on an anti communist basis rather than a pro nationalist basis equally although individual right wing australians may have served with the nationalist rebels they received no public support service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time however as the government received no reports of australians travelling to spain to enlist no action was taken consequently returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the returned and services league of australia rsl although the number of australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries at least 14 were killed
second world war 1939 45
europe and the middle east
australia entered the second world war on 3 september 1939 at the time of the declaration of war against germany the australian military was small and unready for war recruiting for a second australian imperial force 2nd aif began in mid september while there was no rush of volunteers like the first world war a high proportion of australian men of military age had enlisted by mid 1940 four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940 three of which were dispatched to the middle east the raaf s resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the commonwealth air forces through the empire air training scheme eats through which almost 28 000 australians were trained during the war
the australian military s first major engagements of the war were against italian forces in the mediterranean and north africa during 1940 the light cruiser hmas sydney and five elderly destroyers dubbed the scrap iron flotilla by nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels a title proudly accepted by the ships took part in a series of operations as part of the british mediterranean fleet and sank several italian warships the army first saw action in january 1941 when the 6th division formed part of the commonwealth forces during operation compass the division assaulted and captured bardia on 5 january and tobruk on 22 january with tens of thousands of italian troops surrendering at both towns the 6th division took part in the pursuit of the italian army and captured benghazi on 4 february in late february it was withdrawn for service in greece and was replaced by the 9th division
the australian forces in the mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941 during april the 6th division other elements of i corps and several australian warships formed part of the allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend greece from german invasion during the battle of greece at the end of this campaign the 6th division was evacuated to egypt and crete the force at crete subsequently fought in the battle of crete during may which also ended in defeat for the allies over 5 000 australians were captured in these campaigns and the 6th division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat the germans and italians also went on the offensive in north africa at the end of march and drove the commonwealth force there back to near the border with egypt the 9th division and a brigade of the 7th division were besieged at tobruk successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by british units in october during june the main body of the 7th division a brigade of the 6th division and the i corps headquarters took part in the syria lebanon campaign against the vichy french resistance was stronger than expected australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the french capitulated in early july
the majority of australian units in the mediterranean returned to australia in early 1942 after the outbreak of the pacific war the 9th division was the largest unit to remain in the middle east and played a key role in the first battle of el alamein during june and the second battle of el alamein in october the division returned to australia in early 1943 but several raaf squadrons and ran warships took part in the subsequent tunisia campaign and the italian campaign from 1943 until the end of the war
the raaf s role in the strategic air offensive in europe formed australia s main contribution to the defeat of germany approximately 13 000 australian airmen served in dozens of british and five australian squadrons in raf bomber command between 1940 and the end of the war australians took part in all of bomber command s major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on german cities and targets in france australian aircrew in bomber command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the australian military during the second world war and sustained almost 20 percent of all australian deaths in combat 3 486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of western europe during 1944 and 1945 and two raaf maritime patrol squadrons served in the battle of the atlantic
asia and the pacific
from the 1920s australia s defence thinking was dominated by british imperial defence policy which was embodied by the singapore strategy this strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at singapore from which a large british fleet would respond to japanese aggression in the region to this end a high proportion of australian forces in asia were concentrated in malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from japan increased however as a result of the emphasis on co operation with britain relatively few australian military units had been retained in australia and the asia pacific region measures were taken to improve australia s defences as war with japan loomed in 1941 but these proved inadequate in december 1941 the australian army in the pacific comprised the 8th division most of which was stationed in malaya and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in australia the raaf was equipped with 373 aircraft most of which were obsolete trainers and the ran had three cruisers and two destroyers in australian waters
the australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the pacific war the 8th division and raaf squadrons in malaya formed a part of the british commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller japanese invasion force which landed on 7 december the british commonwealth force withdrew to singapore at the end of january but was forced to surrender on 15 february after the japanese captured much of the island smaller australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early 1942 at rabaul and in ambon timor and java the australian town of darwin was heavily bombed by the japanese on 19 february to prevent it from being used as an allied base over 22 000 australians were taken prisoner in early 1942 and endured harsh conditions in japanese captivity the prisoners were subjected to malnutrition denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards as a result 8 296 australian prisoners died in captivity
the rapid allied defeat in the pacific caused many australians to fear that the japanese would invade the australian mainland while elements of the imperial japanese navy proposed this in early 1942 it was judged to be impossible by the japanese imperial general headquarters which instead adopted a strategy of isolating australia from the united states by capturing new guinea the solomon islands fiji samoa and new caledonia this fact was not known by the allies at the time and the australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion large numbers of united states army and army air forces units arrived in australia in early 1942 and the australian military was placed under the overall command of general douglas macarthur in march
australians played a central role in the new guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943 after an attempt to land troops at port moresby was defeated in the battle of the coral sea the japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the owen stanley ranges and milne bay australian army units defeated these offensives in the kokoda track campaign and battle of milne bay with the support of the raaf and usaaf australian and us army units subsequently assaulted and captured the japanese bases on the north coast of papua in the hard fought battle of buna gona the australian army also defeated a japanese attempt to capture the town of wau in january 1943 and went onto the offensive in the salamaua lae campaign in april in late 1943 the 7th and 9th divisions played an important role in operation cartwheel when they landed to the east and west of lae and secured the huon peninsula during the huon peninsula campaign and finisterre range campaign
the australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943 japanese submarines operated off australia from may to august 1942 and january to june 1943 these attacks sought to cut the allied supply lines between australia and the us and australia and new guinea but were unsuccessful japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against allied bases in northern australia which were being used to mount the north western area campaign against japanese positions in the netherlands east indies nei
australia s role in the pacific war declined from 1944 the increasing size of the us forces in the pacific rendered the australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production nevertheless the government wanted the australian military to remain active and agreed to macarthur s proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns in late 1944 australian troops and raaf squadrons replaced us garrisons in eastern new guinea new britain and bougainville and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining japanese forces there in may 1945 i corps the australian first tactical air force and usaaf and usn units began the borneo campaign which continued until the end of the war these campaigns contributed little to japan s defeat and remain controversial
following japan s surrender on 15 august 1945 australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of borneo and the eastern netherlands east indies until british and dutch colonial rule was restored australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of japanese personnel 993 000 australians enlisted during the war while 557 000 served overseas casualties included 39 767 killed and another 66 553 were wounded 20 victoria crosses were awarded to australians
post war period
demobilisation and peace time defence arrangements
the demobilisation of the australian military following the end of the second world war was completed in 1947 plans for post war defence arrangements were predicated on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force it was envisioned that the royal australian navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers two cruisers six destroyers 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserved the royal australian air force would have a strength of 16 squadrons including four manned by the citizen air force meanwhile in a significant departure from previous australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces the australian army would include a permanent field force of 19 000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support serving alongside a part time force of 50 000 men in the citizen military forces the australian regular army was subsequently formed on 30 september 1947 while the cmf was re raised on 1 july 1948
occupation of japan 1946 52
in the immediate post war period australia contributed significant forces to the allied occupation of japan as part of the british commonwealth occupation force bcof which included forces from australia britain india and new zealand at its height in 1946 the australian component consisted of an infantry brigade four warships and three fighter squadrons totalling 13 500 personnel the australian army component initially consisted of the 34th brigade which arrived in japan in february 1946 and was based in hiroshima prefecture the three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st 2nd and 3rd battalions of the royal australian regiment in 1949 and the 34th brigade became the 1st brigade when it returned to australia in december 1948 forming the basis of the post war regular army from that time the australian army contribution to the occupation of japan was reduced to a single under strength battalion australian forces remained until september 1951 when the bcof ceased operations although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the korean peninsular following the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 the raaf component consisted of nos 76 77 and 82 squadrons as part of no 81 wing raaf flying p 51 mustangs initially based at bofu from march 1946 before transferring to iwakuni in 1948 however by 1950 only no 77 squadron remained in japan a total of ten ran warships served in japan during this period including hma ships australia hobart shropshire arunta bataan culgoa murchison shoalhaven quadrant and quiberon while hmas ships manoora westralia and kanimbla also provided support
cold war
early planning and commitments
during the early years of the cold war australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the western world and eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the united nations or a coalition led by either the united states or britain the middle east was considered the most likely area of operations for australian forces where they would most likely operate with british forces early commitments included the involvement of raaf aircrew during the berlin airlift in 1948 49 and the deployment of no 78 wing raaf to malta in the mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 meanwhile defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a national service scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the army raaf and ran
korean war 1950 53
on 25 june 1950 the north korean army kpa crossed the border into south korea and advanced for the capital seoul which fell in less than a week north korean forces continued toward the port of pusan and two days later the united states offered its assistance to south korea in response the united nations security council requested members to assist in repelling the north korean attack australia initially contributed p 51 mustang fighter bomber aircraft from no 77 squadron raaf and infantry from the 3rd battalion royal australian regiment 3 rar both of which were stationed in japan as part of the bcof in addition it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the british commonwealth forces korea the ran frigate hmas shoalhaven and the destroyer hmas bataan were also committed later an aircraft carrier strike group aboard hmas sydney was added to the force
by the time 3 rar arrived in pusan on 28 september the north koreans were in retreat following the inchon landings as a part of the invasion force under the un supreme commander general douglas macarthur the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at battle of yongju near pyongyang on 22 october before advancing towards the yalu river further successful actions followed at kujin on 25 26 october 1950 and at chongju on 29 october 1950 north korean casualties were heavy while australian losses included their commanding officer lieutenant colonel charles green who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 november meanwhile during the last weeks of october the chinese had moved 18 divisions of the people s volunteer army across the yalu river to reinforce the remnants of the kpa undetected by us and south korean intelligence the 13th army group crossed the border on 16 october and penetrated up to 100 kilometres 62 mi into north korea and were reinforced in early november by 12 divisions from the 9th army group in total 30 divisions composed of 380 000 men 3 rar fought its first action against the chinese at pakchon on 5 november the fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake following the chinese intervention the un forces were defeated in successive battles and 3 rar was forced to withdraw to the 38th parallel
a series of battles followed at uijeongbu on 1 4 january 1951 as the british and australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the south korean capital further fighting occurred at chuam ni on 14 17 february 1951 following another chinese advance and later at maehwa san between 7 12 march 1951 as the un resumed the offensive australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in 1951 with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the battle of kapyong on 22 april chinese forces attacked the kapyong valley and forced the south korean defenders to withdraw australian and canadian troops were ordered to halt this chinese advance after a night of fighting the australians recaptured their positions at the cost of 32 men killed and 59 wounded in july 1951 the australian battalion became part of the combined canadian british australian new zealand and indian 1st commonwealth division the second major battle took place during operation commando and occurred after the chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the imjin river the 1st commonwealth division counter attacked on 3 october capturing a number of objectives including hill 355 and hill 317 during the battle of maryang san after five days the chinese retreated australian casualties included 20 dead and 104 wounded
the belligerents then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the first world war in which men lived in tunnels redoubts and sandbagged forts behind barbed wire defences from 1951 until the end of the war 3 rar held trenches on the eastern side of the division s positions in the hills northeast of the imjin river across from them were heavily fortified chinese positions in march 1952 australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions sending 1 rar this battalion remained in korea for 12 months before being replaced by 2 rar in april 1953 the australians fought their last battle during 24 26 july 1953 with 2 rar holding off a concerted chinese attack along the samichon river and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded hostilities were suspended on 27 july 1953 17 808 australians served during the war with 341 killed 1 216 wounded and 30 captured
malayan emergency 1950 60
the malayan emergency was declared on 18 june 1948 after three estate managers were murdered by members of the malayan communist party mcp australian involvement began in june 1950 when in response to a british request six lincolns from no 1 squadron and a flight of dakotas from no 38 squadron arrived in singapore to form part of the british commonwealth far east air force feaf the dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs troop movement as well as paratroop and leaflet drops while the lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the communist terrorist ct jungle bases the raaf were particularly successful and in one such mission known as operation termite five lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender in a joint operation with the raf and ground troops the lincolns were withdrawn in 1958 and were replaced by canberra bombers from no 2 squadron and cac sabres from no 78 wing based at raaf base butterworth they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas
australian ground forces were deployed to malaya in october 1955 as part of the far east strategic reserve in january 1956 the first australian ground forces were deployed on malaysian peninsula consisting of the 2nd battalion royal australian regiment 2 rar 2 rar mainly participated in mopping up operations over the next 20 months conducting extensive patrolling in and near the ct jungle bases as part of 28th british commonwealth brigade contact with the enemy was infrequent and results small achieving relatively few kills 2 rar left malaysia october 1957 to be replaced by 3 rar 3 rar underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving mcp insurgents back into the jungle of perak and kedah the new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes again contact was limited although 3 rar had more success than its predecessor by late 1959 operations against the mcp were in their final phase and most communists had been pushed back and across the thailand border 3 rar left malaysia october 1959 and was replaced by 1 rar though patrolling the border 1 rar did not make contact with the insurgents and in october 1960 it was replaced by 2 rar which stayed in malaysia until august 1963 the malayan emergency officially ended on 31 july 1960
australia also provided artillery and engineer support along with an air field construction squadron the royal australian navy also served in malayan waters firing on suspected communist positions between 1956 and 1957 the emergency was the longest continued commitment in australian military history 7 000 australians served and 51 died in malaya although only 15 were on operations and another 27 were wounded
military and naval growth during the 1960s
at the start of the 1960s prime minister robert menzies greatly expanded the australian military so that it could carry out the government s policy of forward defence in south east asia in 1964 menzies announced a large increase in defence spending the strength of the australian army would be increased by 50 over three years from 22 000 to 33 000 providing a full three brigade division with nine battalions the raaf and ran would also both be increased by 25 in 1964 conscription or national service was re introduced under the national service act for selected 20 year olds based on date of birth for a period of two years continuous full time service the previous scheme having been suspended in 1959
in 1961 three charles f adams class destroyers were purchased from the united states to replace the ageing q class destroyers traditionally the ran had purchased designs based on those of the royal navy and the purchase of american destroyers was significant hmas perth and hmas hobart joined the fleet in 1965 followed by hmas brisbane in 1967 other projects included the construction of six river class frigates the conversion of the aircraft carrier hmas melbourne to an anti submarine role the acquisition of ten wessex helicopters and the purchase of six oberon class submarines
the raaf took delivery of their first mirage fighters in 1967 equipping no 3 no 75 and no 77 squadrons with them the service also received american f 111 strike aircraft c 130 hercules transports p 3 orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and italian macchi trainers
indonesia malaysia confrontation 1962 66
the indonesia malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the british commonwealth and indonesia over the creation of the federation of malaysia with the commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state the war remained limited and was fought primarily on the island of borneo although a number of indonesian seaborne and airborne incursions onto the malay peninsula did occur as part of australia s continuing military commitment to the security of malaysia army naval and airforce units were based there as part of the far east strategic reserve regardless the australian government was wary of involvement in a war with indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the malayan peninsula only on two occasions australian troops from 3 rar were used to help mop up infiltrators from seaborne and airborne incursions at labis and pontian in september and october 1964
following these raids the government conceded to british and malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to borneo during the early phases british and malaysian troops had attempted only to control the malaysian indonesian border and to protect population centres however by the time the australian battalion deployed the british had decided on more aggressive action crossing the border into kalimantan to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the indonesians to remain on the defensive under the codename operation claret the fighting took place in mountainous jungle clad terrain and a debilitating climate with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border cross border operations the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions
3 rar deployed to borneo in march 1965 and served in sarawak until the end of july operating on both sides of the border the battalion had four major contacts with indonesian forces and several smaller ones including at sungei koemba kindau and babang during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the indonesians as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents 4 rar served a less eventful tour between april and august 1966 and also operated over the border successfully clashing with the indonesians on a number of occasions a squadron of the special air service regiment sasr was also deployed in 1965 and again in 1966 taking part in cross border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the indonesians even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance other units included artillery and engineers while a number of ran ships were involved in shelling indonesian positions in borneo and in repelling infiltrators in the singapore strait the raaf played a relatively minor role although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated
operations in borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in australia while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross border missions only occurred in 1996 following a military coup in indonesia in early 1966 which brought general suharto to power a peace treaty was signed in august 1966 which ended the conflict 3 500 australians served during confrontation casualties included 16 dead with seven killed in action and eight wounded
vietnam war 1962 73
australia s involvement in the vietnam war was driven largely by the rise of communism in southeast asia after the second world war and the fear of its spread which developed in australia during the 1950s and early 1960s as a consequence australia supported south vietnam throughout the early 1960s in 1961 and 1962 the leader of the south vietnamese government ngo dinh diem asked for assistance from the us and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist north vietnam australia offered 30 military advisors from the australian army training team vietnam which became known simply as the team they arrived in july and august 1962 beginning australia s involvement in the war later in august 1964 the raaf sent a flight of caribou transport aircraft to the port city of vung tau
however with the security situation in south vietnam continuing to deteriorate the us increased its involvement to 200 000 combat troops by early 1965 australia also committed ground forces dispatching the 1 rar to serve with the us 173rd airborne brigade in bien hoa province in june 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions including gang toi operation crimp and suoi bong trang in march 1966 the australian government announced the deployment of a brigade sized unit the 1st australian task force 1 atf to replace 1 rar included were a large number of conscripts under the increasingly controversial national service scheme consisting of two infantry battalions as well as armour aviation artillery and other support arms the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at nui dat in phuoc tuy province included were the iroquois helicopters of no 9 squadron raaf at the battle of long tan on 18 august 1966 d company 6 rar with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a viet cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself 18 australians were killed and 24 wounded while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield the battle allowed the australians to gain dominance over phuoc tuy province and 1 atf was not fundamentally challenged again regardless during february 1967 the australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week the bulk during operation bribie
yet with the phuoc tuy province coming progressively under control throughout 1967 the australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield 1 atf was subsequently deployed astride infiltration routes leading to saigon to interdict communist movement against the capital as part of operation coburg during the 1968 tet offensive and later during the battle of coral balmoral in may and june 1968 at fire support bases coral and balmoral the australians had clashed with regular north vietnamese army and viet cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare ultimately fighting their largest most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war during 26 days of fighting australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count 60 possibly killed 7 wounded and 11 captured other significant australian actions included binh ba in june 1969 hat dich in late december 1968 and early 1969 and long khanh in june 1971 at the height of the australian commitment 1 atf numbered 8 500 troops including three infantry battalions armour artillery engineers logistics and aviation units in support a third raaf unit no 2 squadron raaf flying canberra bombers was sent in 1967 and four ran destroyers joined us patrols in the waters off north vietnam
the australian withdrawal effectively commenced in november 1970 as a consequence of the overall allied strategy of vietnamization and with the australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war 8 rar was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty 1 atf was again reduced to just two infantry battalions albeit with significant armour artillery and aviation support remaining australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal and 1 atf ceased operations in october meanwhile the advisors remained to train south vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 december 1972 by the newly elected labor government of gough whitlam the last australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973 the vietnam war was australia s longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support as the nation s military involvement increased a vocal anti war movement developed more than 50 000 australians served in vietnam 519 were killed and 2 398 were wounded four were awarded the victoria cross
post vietnam era
creation of the australian defence force 1976
although the importance of joint warfare had been highlighted during second world war when australian naval ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co ordination between the services in the post war era with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine the need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the australian military s experiences in the vietnam war in 1973 the secretary of the department of defence arthur tange submitted a report to the government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of chief of the defence force staff
the whitlam labor government subsequently amalgamated the five defence ministries defence navy army air force and supply into a single department of defence in 1973 while conscription under the national service scheme was abolished on 1 january 1976 the three branches of the australian military were brought together as a unified all volunteer professional force known as the australian defence force adf today the adf is headquartered at russell offices in canberra and is divided into air land maritime and special operations commands in addition northern command is based in darwin and is responsible for operations in northern australia
defence of australia 1980s and 1990s
until the 1970s australia s military strategy centred on the concept of forward defence in which the role of australian military and naval forces were to co operate with allied forces to counter threats in australia s region following the adoption of the guam doctrine by the united states in 1969 and the british withdrawal east of suez in the early 1970s australia developed a defence policy emphasising self reliance and the defence of the australian continent known as the defence of australia policy it focused australian defence planning on protecting the nation s northern maritime approaches the air sea gap against possible attack
in line with this goal the adf was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from australian bases and to counter raids on continental australia this was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the ran and raaf and relocating regular army units to northern australia during this time the adf had no military units on operational deployment outside australia however in 1987 the adf made its first operational deployment as part of operation morris dance in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off fiji in response to the 1987 fijian coups d tat while broadly successful this deployment highlighted the need for the adf to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events
during this period australia continued to retain forces in malaysia as part of the five power defence arrangements fpda agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack with this commitment initially including significant air ground and naval forces however these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from singapore in 1973 and the two mirage fighter squadrons in 1988 since then a detachment of orion maritime patrol aircraft support personnel and an infantry company known as rifle company butterworth have been maintained as well as occasional deployments of f a 18 hornet fighter aircraft australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout asian waters in the last decades of the cold war airforce and navy units were also involved in tracking soviet ship and submarine movements in the region since then the orions have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of operation gateway conducting patrols over the indian ocean strait of malacca and south china sea they have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights
gulf war 1991
australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 gulf war deploying a naval task group of two warships a support ship and a clearance diving team in total about 750 personnel the australian contribution was the first time australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the adf and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure however the australian force did not see combat and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against iraq following the invasion of kuwait some adf personnel serving on exchange with british and american units did see combat and a few were later decorated for their actions following the war the navy regularly deployed a frigate to the persian gulf or red sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to iraq a number of australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with us and british air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no fly zones imposed over iraq between 1991 and 2003
global security late 1990s
since the late 1980s the australian government had increasingly called upon the adf to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world while most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel large peacekeeping deployments were made to namibia in early 1989 cambodia between 1992 and 1993 somalia in 1993 rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards the 1996 election of the howard liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the adf s force structure and role with the new government s defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co operation with regional states and australia s allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of australia s global security interests in line with this new focus the adf s force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the adf s combat effectiveness
new millennium
east timor 1999 2013
the former portuguese colony of east timor was invaded by indonesia in 1975 however following years of violent struggle the new indonesian government of president b j habibie subsequently agreed to allow the east timorese to vote on autonomy in 1999 the united nations mission in east timor unamet was established to organise and conduct the vote which was held at the end of august 1999 and resulted with 78 5 of voters deciding in favour of independence however following the announcement of the results pro indonesian militias supported by elements of the indonesian military launched a campaign of violence looting and arson and many east timorese were killed while perhaps more than 500 000 were displaced unable to control the violence indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force australia which had contributed police to unamet organised and led an international military coalition known as the international force for east timor interfet a non un force operating in accordance with un resolutions the total size of the australian force committed numbered 5 500 personnel and included a significant ground force supported by air and naval forces in the largest single deployment of australian forces since 1945
under the overall command of australian major general peter cosgrove interfet began arriving on 12 september 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security protecting and supporting unamet and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations with the withdrawal of the indonesian armed forces police and government officials from east timor unamet re established its headquarters in dili on 28 september on 19 october 1999 indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a un peacekeeping force the united nations transitional administration in east timor untaet was established becoming fully responsible for the administration of east timor during its transition to independence the hand over of command of military operations from interfet to untaet was completed on 28 february 2000 australia continued to support the un peacekeeping operation with between 1 500 and 2 000 personnel as well as landing craft and blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission during these operations australian forces regularly clashed with pro indonesian militia and on a number of occasions indonesian forces as well especially along the border with west timor significant actions occurred in suai mota ain and at aidabasalala in october 1999 however with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the australian and un forces were withdrawn by 2005 two australians died from non battle related causes while a number were wounded in action
the unexpected deployment to east timor in 1999 led to significant changes in australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the adf s ability to conduct operations outside australia this successful deployment was the first time a large australian military force had operated outside of australia since the vietnam war and revealed shortcomings in the adf s ability to mount and sustain such operations in response the 2000 defence white paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the adf for overseas deployments the australian government committed to improve the adf s capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of adf units expanding the adf to 57 000 full time personnel and increasing real defence expenditure by 3 per year
in may 2006 2 000 adf personnel were again deployed to east timor as part of operation astute following unrest between elements of the timor leste defence force australian forces were involved in a number skirmishes during this time including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by alfredo reinado at same on 4 march 2007 however by early 2010 the security situation had been stabilised and just 400 australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force following a drawdown the international stabilisation force commenced withdrawing from timor leste in november 2012 a process which was completed in april 2013
afghanistan 2001 present
shortly after the islamist inspired terrorist attacks in new york and washington on 11 september 2001 australian forces were committed to the american led international coalition against terrorism the adf s most visible contribution codenamed operation slipper has been a special forces task group operating in afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 and again from mid 2005 to fight against the taliban over time the australian commitment has grown with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a reconstruction task force from 2006 to provide security reconstruction and to mentor and train the afghan national army australia has also contributed a frigate and two ap 3c orion surveillance aircraft and three c 130 hercules transport aircraft to international operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean since 2001 supporting both the operations in afghanistan and those in iraq under operation catalyst a detachment of four f a 18 hornet fighter bombers was based at diego garcia from late 2001 to mid 2002 while two boeing 707 air to air refuelling aircraft were also based in manas air base in kyrgyzstan to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in afghan airspace but were later withdrawn a special operations task group was deployed to support the reconstruction taskforce in april 2007 in addition to radar crews logistics and intelligence officers and security personnel this brought the number of australian personnel in afghanistan to 950 by mid 2007 with further small increases to 1 000 in mid 2008 1 100 in early 2009 and 1 550 in mid 2009
a modest force remained in afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter insurgency operations in uruzgan province in conjunction united states and other coalition forces including the dutch prior to their withdrawal the force consisted of motorised infantry special forces engineers cavalry artillery and aviation elements by 2010 it included a combined arms battalion sized battle group known as the mentoring task force and the special operations task group both based at forward operation base ripley outside of tarin kowt as well as the rotary wing group flying ch 47d chinooks the force logistics asset and an raaf air surveillance radar unit based in kandahar in addition a further 800 australian logistic personnel were also based in the middle east in support but are located outside of afghanistan meanwhile detachments of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in iraq and afghanistan based out of al minhad air base in the united arab emirates also included is the deployment of one of the ran s frigates to the arabian sea and gulf of aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties
australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting and significant actions included operation anaconda in 2002 and operation perth in 2006 as well as actions in chora in 2007 kakarak in 2009 the shah wali kot and derapet in 2010 and doan in 2011 although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded while another australian also died serving with the british army four australians have been awarded the victoria cross for australia the first such decorations in forty years following a drawdown in forces the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 december 2013 however approximately 400 personnel remain in afghanistan as trainers and advisers and are stationed in kandahar and kabul over 26 000 australian personnel have served in afghanistan
iraq 2003 11
australian forces later joined british and american forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq the initial contribution was also a modest one consisting of just 2 058 personnel codenamed operation falconer major force elements included special forces rotary and fixed wing aviation and naval units army units included elements from the sasr and 4th battalion royal australian regiment commando a ch 47 chinook detachment and a number of other specialist units ran units included the amphibious ship hmas kanimbla and the frigates hmas darwin and hmas anzac while the raaf deployed 14 f a 18 hornets from no 75 squadron a number of ap 3c orions and c 130 hercules the australian special forces task force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into iraq while for a few days the closest ground troops to baghdad were from the sasr during the invasion the raaf also flew its first combat missions since the vietnam war with no 75 squadron flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser guided bombs
the iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power and with their defeat the bulk of australian forces were withdrawn while australia did not initially take part in the post war occupation of iraq an australian army light armoured battlegroup designated the al muthanna task group and including 40 aslav light armoured vehicles and infantry was later deployed to southern iraq in april 2005 as part of operation catalyst the role of this force was to protect the japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of new iraqi army units the amtg later became the overwatch battle group west obg w following the hand back of al muthanna province to iraqi control force levels peaked at 1 400 personnel in may 2007 including the obg w in southern iraq the security detachment in baghdad and the australian army training team iraq a ran frigate was based in the north persian gulf while raaf assets included c 130h hercules and ap 3c elements following the election of a new labor government under prime minister kevin rudd the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid 2009 while raaf and ran operations were redirected to other parts of the middle east area of operations as part of operation slipper
low level operations continued however with a small australian force of 80 soldiers remaining in iraq to protect the australian embassy in baghdad as part of secdet under operation kruger secdet was finally withdrawn in august 2011 and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for australia s diplomatic presence in iraq although more than 17 000 personnel served during operations in iraq australian casualties were relatively light with two soldiers accidentally killed while a third australian died serving with the british royal air force a further 27 personnel were wounded two officers remained in iraq attached to the united nations assistance mission for iraq as part of operation riverbank this operation concluded in november 2013
military intervention against isil 2014 present
in june 2014 a small number of sasr personnel were deployed to iraq to protect the australian embassy when the security of baghdad was threatened by the 2014 northern iraq offensive later in august and september a number of raaf c 17 and c 130j transport aircraft based in the middle east were used to conduct airdrops of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to airlift arms and munitions to forces in kurdish controlled northern iraq in late september 2014 an air task group atg and special operations task group sotg were deployed to al minhad air base in the united arab emirates as part of the coalition to combat islamic state forces in iraq equipped with f a 18f super hornet strike aircraft a kc 30a multi role tanker transport and an e 7a wedgetail airborne early warning control aircraft the atg began operations on 1 october the sotg is tasked with operations to advise and assist iraqi security forces and was deployed to iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the australian and iraqi governments it began moving into iraq in early november in april 2015 a 300 strong unit known as task group taji was deployed to iraq to train the regular iraqi security forces airstrikes were extended to syria in september 2015
peacekeeping
australia s involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse and included participation in both united nations sponsored missions as well as those as part of ad hoc coalitions australians have been involved in more conflicts as peacekeepers than as belligerents however in comparative international terms australia has only been a moderately energetic peacekeeper although australia has had peacekeepers in the field continuously for 60 years being among the first group of un military observers in indonesia in 1947 its commitments have generally been limited consisting mostly of small numbers of high level and technical support troops such as signallers engineers medics observers and police one significant commitment has been australia s ongoing involvement with the long running multinational force and observers in the sinai the operational tempo started increasing in the mid 1990s when australia became involved in a series of high profile operations deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including cambodia rwanda somalia east timor and the solomon islands australia has been involved in close to 100 separate missions involving more than 30 000 personnel 14 australians have died during these operations

ward churchill
ward leroy churchill born 1947 is an american author and political activist he was a professor of ethnic studies at the university of colorado boulder from 1990 until 2007 the primary focus of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and native americans by the united states government his work features controversial and provocative views written in a direct often confrontational style
in january 2005 churchill s work attracted controversy because of the circulation of a 2001 essay on the justice of roosting chickens in which he argued the september 11 attacks were a natural and unavoidable consequence of unlawful us foreign policy over the latter half of the 20th century the essay is well known for churchill s use of the phrase little eichmanns to describe the technocratic corps working in the world trade center
in march 2005 the university of colorado began investigating allegations that churchill had engaged in research misconduct it reported in june 2006 that he had done so churchill was fired on july 24 2007 leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired because of the little eichmanns comment churchill filed a lawsuit against the university of colorado for unlawful termination of employment in april 2009 a denver jury found that churchill was wrongly fired awarding him 1 in damages in july 2009 a district court judge vacated the monetary award and declined churchill s request to order his reinstatement deciding the university has quasi judicial immunity in february 2010 churchill appealed the judge s decision in november 2010 the colorado court of appeals upheld the lower court s ruling in september 10 2012 the colorado supreme court upheld the lower courts decisions in favor of the university of colorado on april 1 2013 the united states supreme court declined to hear the case
in a february 2014 interview churchill commented that after living more than forty years in the northern plains colorado region he had relocated to atlanta georgia in 2013 churchill also stated that he had a half dozen uncompleted books which he intended to finish and publish in the next three years
early life and education
churchill was born in urbana illinois to jack leroy churchill and maralyn lucretia allen his parents divorced before he was two and he grew up in elmwood where he attended local schools
in 1966 he was drafted into the united states army on his 1980 resume he said he served as a public information specialist who wrote and edited the battalion newsletter and wrote news releases
in a 1987 profile on churchill the denver post reported that he was drafted went to paratrooper school then volunteered for vietnam where he served a 10 month tour as long range reconnaissance patrol lrrp one of a six man team sent out to track down the enemy the post article also reported that churchill was politically radicalized as a result of his experiences in vietnam churchill told the post that he had spent some time at the chicago office of the students for a democratic society sds in the late 1960s and briefly taught members of the weather underground how to build bombs and fire weapons
in 2005 the denver post reported that churchill s military records show he was trained as a film projectionist and light truck driver but they do not reflect paratrooper school or lrrp training the 75th ranger regiment association found no record of churchill having been a member of the unit or a lrrp team
churchill received his b a in technological communications in 1974 and m a in communications theory in 1975 both from sangamon state university now the university of illinois at springfield
career
in 1978 churchill began working at the university of colorado boulder as an affirmative action officer in the university administration he also lectured on american indian issues in the ethnic studies program in 1990 the university of colorado hired him as an associate professor although he did not possess the academic doctorate usually required for the position the following year he was granted tenure in the communications department without the usual six year probationary period after having been declined by the sociology and political science departments
he has long been interested in issues associated with the dawes act which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households connected with that was the federal government s first use of blood quantum to define individual membership in tribes for what became known as the dawes rolls since re establishing self governments federally recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members often related to descent from recognized historical lists but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum some of his published works address these issues which he has interpreted as part of the federal government s policy of genocide against native americans
in 1995 churchill discussed his views with david barsamian in an interview
you could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in ibero america but in anglo america while there was some preoccupation with it it was not formalized until the passage of the general allotment act mid 1880s at that point they began to define indian as being someone who was demonstrably and documentably of at least one quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group you couldn t be an eighth cheyenne and an eighth arapaho and be an indian you had to be a quarter cheyenne or a quarter arapaho or hopefully a quarter and a quarter the reason for this was quite clear they were identifying indians for purposes of allotting them individual parcels of land in the existing reservation base at that point if they ran out of indians identifiable as such then the rest of the land would be declared surplus so it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of indianness that would minimize the number of indians that were available it was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to indianness in the first place it s become increasingly so ever since david barsamian december 1995 interview with ward churchill historical and current perspectives z magazine
in 1996 churchill moved to the new ethnic studies department of the university of colorado in 1997 he was promoted to full professor he was selected as chairman of the department in june 2002
in january 2005 during the controversy over his 9 11 remarks churchill resigned as chairman of the ethnic studies department at the university of colorado his term as chair was scheduled to expire in june of that year on may 16 2006 the investigative committee of the standing committee on research misconduct at the university of colorado concluded that churchill had committed multiple counts of academic misconduct specifically plagiarism fabrication and falsification on july 24 2007 churchill was fired for academic misconduct in an eight to one vote by the university of colorado s board of regents
genealogy and tribal affiliation
in 2003 churchill stated i am myself of muscogee and creek descent on my father s side cherokee on my mother s and am an enrolled member of the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians in 1992 churchill wrote elsewhere that he is one eighth creek and one sixteenth cherokee in 1993 churchill told the colorado daily that he was one sixteenth creek and cherokee churchill told the denver post in february 2005 that he is three sixteenths cherokee
in a statement dated may 9 2005 and posted on its website the united keetoowah band initially said
the united keetoowah band would like to make it clear that mr churchill is not a member of the keetoowah band and was only given an honorary associate membership in the early 1990s because he could not prove any cherokee ancestry the tribe said that all of churchill s past present and future claims or assertions of keetoowah enrollment written or spoken including but not limited to biographies curriculum vitae lectures applications for employment or any other reference not listed herein are deemed fraudulent by the united keetoowah band
two days later the united keetoowah band replaced its statement and acknowledged churchill s alleged ancestry of being cherokee
because mr churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry and his willingness to assist the ukb in promoting the tribe and its causes he was awarded an associate membership as an honor the tribe s website now said however mr churchill may possess eligibility status for cherokee nation of oklahoma since he claims 1 16 cherokee
the tribe s spokesperson lisa stopp stated the tribe enrolls only members with certified one quarter american indian blood the website statement further clarified that churchill was not eligible for tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a certificate of degree of indian blood cdib and the associate membership did not entitle an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe
churchill has never asked for cdib certification and finds the idea of being vetted by the us government offensive
in june 1994 the united keetoowah band had voted to stop awarding associate memberships such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual s assistance to the tribe but it has nothing to do with indian ancestry and it does not entitle an individual to vote in the tribe as a member the keetoowah band states that churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded in a separate interview ernestine berry formerly on the tribe s enrollment committee and four years on its council said that churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe
in june 2005 the rocky mountain news published an article about churchill s genealogy and family history it turned up no evidence of a single indian ancestor among 142 direct ancestors of churchill s identified from records the news reported that both churchill s birth parents were listed as white on the 1930 census as were all but two of his great great grandparents listed on previous census and other official documents the news found that some of churchill s accounts of where his ancestors had lived did not agree with documented records numerous members of churchill s extended family have longstanding family legends of indian ancestry among ancestors but none was confirmed among the 142 direct forebears of churchill who were identified
documents in churchill s university personnel file show that he was granted tenure in a special opportunity position in 1994 then cu boulder chancellor james corbridge refused to take action on allegations that churchill was fraudulently claiming to be an indian saying it has always been university policy that a person s race or ethnicity is self proving
some of churchill s native american critics such as vernon bellecourt white earth ojibwe and suzan shown harjo southern cheyenne muscogee creek argue that his assertion of native american ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute misrepresentation and grounds for termination the university has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity the university of colorado s research misconduct committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship the committee concluded that the allegation was not appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct
in a 2005 interview in the rocky mountain news churchill said i have never been confirmed as having one quarter blood and never said i was and even if the critics are absolutely right what does that have to do with this issue i have never claimed to be goddamned sitting bull the longtime indigenous activist russell means said in february of that year so i want from this day forward every media person nationally internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that ward churchill is a full blooded indian leader
blood quantum
churchill has responded to requests for verification of his claimed indian heritage in various ways including attacking the blood quantum upon which some native american tribes establish their membership requirements churchill argues that the united states instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency
for decades in his writings churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose he says
set the blood quantum at one quarter hold to it as a rigid definition of indians let intermarriage proceed as it has and eventually indians will be defined out of existence
churchill s assertions have been raised as one of the several research misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 see below he has been accused of using his interpretation of the dawes act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member
writing
churchill has written on american indian history and culture and speaks about genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the americas by european settlers and what he describes as the repression of native peoples that continues to this day
as of 2007 according to a report submitted on his behalf churchill has written 10 books on his own and co authored 4 some have been reprinted with updates he has written 51 book chapters 3 law reviews and 50 scholarly essays 27 of these were refereed he has edited 4 volumes and co edited 3 more
according to the university of colorado investigation his academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation drawing upon studies by other scholars not monographs describing new research based on primary sources the investigation also noted that he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals not in the university presses or mainstream peer reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics in addition to his academic writing churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion

activism on native american issues
churchill has been active since at least 1984 as the co director of the denver based american indian movement of colorado now an autonomous chapter of the american indian movement in 1993 he and other local aim leaders including russell means glenn t morris robert robideau and david hill broke with the national aim leadership including dennis banks and the brothers vernon and clyde bellecourt claiming that all aim chapters are autonomous the aim grand governing council is based in minneapolis and retains the name of the national group it says that the schism arose when means churchill glenn t morris and others openly supported the miskito indian group misurasata who were allied with the anti revolutionary cia backed contras
journalists such as harlan mckosato attributed the split to means and other aim members dividing over opposition to the bellecourt brothers because of their alleged involvement in the execution of anna mae aquash in december 1975 who was then the highest ranking woman in aim but had been suspected of being an informant it was a year in which other fbi informants had been discovered in aim on november 3 1999 means held a press conference in denver colorado in which he accused the bellecourt brothers of complicity in aquash s death and named three lower level aim members involved in her death arlo looking cloud john graham and theda nelson clark this was the first time that an aim leader active at the time of the aquash murder had publicly accused aim of having been involved
looking cloud and graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010 by federal and south dakota state juries respectively by then clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted means attributed the split in aim to divisions in the aftermath of aquash s murder the journalist harlan mckosato said in 1999 her aquash s death has divided the american indian movement
the schism continued with the national aim leadership claiming that the local aim leaders such as churchill are tools of the u s government used against other american indians the leaders of the national aim organization now called aim grand governing council claim that churchill has worked in the past as an underground counter intelligence source for the u s government for example the fbi and local non indian police forces to subvert the national aim organization specifically they refer to a 1993 boulder colorado interview with jodi rave a former columnist for the denver post in which churchill stated that he was teaching the rapid city police department about the american indian movement in addition vernon bellecourt accused churchill of having fraudulently represented himself as an indian to bolster his credentials bellecourt said he complained to the university of colorado about this as early as 1986
churchill has been a leader of colorado aim s annual protests in denver against the columbus day holiday and its associated parade colorado aim s leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the denver italian american community the main supporters of the parade as early as 2004 churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional arguing that the ninth amendment to the constitution provides native americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays overriding the first amendment rights of non native americans
9 11 essay controversy
churchill wrote an essay in september 2001 entitled on the justice of roosting chickens in it he argued that the september 11 attacks were provoked by u s foreign policy he compared the role of financial workers at the world trade center in ongoing genocidal american imperialism to the role played by adolf eichmann in organizing the holocaust in 2005 this essay was widely publicized when hamilton college invited churchill to speak this led to both condemnations of churchill and counter accusations of mccarthyism by churchill and supporters following the controversy the university of colorado interim chancellor phil distefano said while professor churchill has the constitutional right to express his political views his essay on 9 11 has outraged and appalled us and the general public
a documentary called shouting fire stories from the edge of free speech broadcast on hbo prominently features churchill s case in addressing the issues of free speech and first amendment rights
research misconduct investigation
the controversy attracted increased academic attention to churchill s research which had already been criticized by the legal scholar john lavelle and historian guenter lewy additional critics were the sociologist thomas brown who had been preparing an article on churchill s work and the historians r g robertson and russell thornton who claimed that churchill had misrepresented their work in 2005 university of colorado boulder administrators ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research misconduct including three allegations of plagiarism and four allegations of fabrication or falsification regarding the history of the dawes act the indian arts and crafts act of 1990 and statements that smallpox was intentionally spread to native americans by john smith in 1614 and by the united states army at fort clark in 1837 not to be confused with the well documented use of smallpox infected blankets at fort pitt in 1764
on may 16 2006 the university released their findings the investigative committee agreed unanimously that churchill had engaged in serious research misconduct including falsification fabrication and two of the three allegations of plagiarism the committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions the standing committee on research misconduct accepted the findings of the investigative committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed churchill s appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the university s privilege and tenure committee which found that two of the seven findings of misconduct did not constitute dismissible offences three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year s suspension without pay while two favored dismissal
on july 24 2007 the university regents voted seven to two to uphold all seven of the findings of research misconduct overruling the recommendation of privilege and tenure panel that two be dismissed by a vote of eight to one the regents determined to fire churchill
the next day churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views the jury in churchill s suit for reinstatement weighed the university s claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case as stanley fish said it was the jury s task to determine whether churchill s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements the jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to churchill s firing and rejected the university s academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal on april 1 2009 a colorado jury found that churchill had been wrongly fired and awarded 1 in damages as one of the jurors said later in a press interview it wasn t a slap in his face or anything like that when we didn t give him any money it s just that churchill s attorney david lane kept saying this wasn t about the money and in the end we took his word for that churchill s counsel asked chief judge larry j naves of the denver district court to order reinstatement in light of the verdict
on july 7 2009 judge naves found that the defendants university were entitled to quasi judicial immunity as a matter of law vacated the jury verdict and determined that the university did not owe churchill any financial compensation naves denied churchill s request for reinstatement at cu
churchill appealed both decisions on november 24 2010 a three judge panel of the colorado court of appeals affirmed the trial court s decision in february 2011 churchill filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the colorado supreme court in late may 2011 the colorado supreme court agreed to hear his case court records indicate that oral arguments began june 7 2012 on september 10 2012 the court ruled that the university had quasi judicial immunity upholding the trial court s ruling on april 1 2013 the u s supreme court declined to hear an appeal from churchill

production
exit through the kwik e mart was written by marc wilmore and directed by steven dean moore as part of the twenty third season of the simpsons 2011 12 it spoofs the debated status of street art as a true form of art the title is a reference to exit through the gift shop a 2010 street art documentary by graffiti artist banksy who produced the opening sequence of an earlier simpsons episode titled moneybart 2010 the richard hawley song tonight the streets are ours which is the theme song of exit through the gift shop is included in the episode during a montage of bart painting graffiti in springfield hayden childs of the a v club noted in his review of exit through the kwik e mart that the reveal that the art show was a police sting gives the show a moment to joke about the anti art market theme from exit through the gift shop wiggum asks who would be stupid enough to pay for work that an amateur puts up for free in public and the answer is as in banksy s movie the very wealthy here represented by mr burns
american street artist fairey guest starred in exit through the kwik e mart as himself the graffiti art featuring homer s face and the word dope that bart creates in the episode is a reference to fairey s barack obama hope poster and his obey giant image fairey has said that the simpsons has been one of his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its blend of humor and social commentary and he felt deeply honored to be included in an episode fairey wrote on his website that part of being on the simpsons is you re being honored as a reference point in culture he described the plot of the episode as great adding that the staff members of the show were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed even though i had to make fun of myself to do so this was fairey s first acting performance street artists english scharf and conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves
the traditional simpsons opening sequence was replaced in this episode with a redesigned version that spoofed the opening sequence of the hbo medieval fantasy series game of thrones the game of thrones opening shows the various locations featured in the series on a three dimensional map of the fictional continent westeros in the simpsons opening these locations were substituted with places in springfield and the wall was replaced with the simpson family s couch the theme song featured in the game of thrones opening sequence was arranged by the simpsons composer alf clausen and used in the simpsons opening as well nicholas mckaig known for uploading a cappella covers of famous songs on youtube performed the simpsons theme song over the closing credits of exit through the kwik e mart he was recruited after a staff member of the show saw his cover of the simpsons theme on youtube

fort scott national historic site
fort scott national historic site is a historical area under the control of the united states national park service in bourbon county kansas united states named after general winfield scott who achieved renown during the mexican american war during the middle of the 19th century the fort served as a military base for us army action in what was the edge of settlement in 1850 for the next quarter century it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the west to settlement a period which included bleeding kansas and the american civil war
the current national historic site protects 20 historic structures a parade ground and five acres 20 000 m of restored tallgrass prairie inside the city of fort scott it is open to visitors most days of the year
history
in 1842 fort scott was named after winfield scott was established on the american frontier on the military road in eastern kansas between fort leavenworth and fort gibson it was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers who were migrating from the eastern united states fort scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the plains indians as well as to protect the indians from the settlers encroachment
the united states government intention to reserve permanent indian lands west of the missouri river gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to encroach on the indian settlements fort scott s most active days were between 1842 and 1853 although it was also used during the civil war
army days
the cherokee of indian territory now oklahoma were upset to have fort wayne in their proximity after some delay the us army decided to abandon fort wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between fort leavenworth and the site the army both wanted to placate the cherokee who were supervised by the department of defense and provide more defense for white settlers and other indians against the osage who had been conducting frequent raids in the area on april 1 1842 some soldiers of fort wayne left their fort and on april 22 arrived where fort scott would be built in the osage cuestas section of modern day kansas after haggling with the cherokees to acquire the land the rest of fort wayne s garrison left the fort on may 26 and arrived at the fort scott site on may 30
unlike most forts for military use the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built the wide open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary the soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men animals and equipment these buildings were on the edges of a 350 foot 110 m parade ground
the post quartermaster captain thomas swords was in charge of building fort scott s structures and had to deal with the problems of construction on the kansas prairie which had few trees he had only two bricklayers and three carpenters to rely on as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform wood was available but the mill was built 1 5 miles 2 4 km away making transport time consuming swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood skilled labor and working equipment freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort s construction as a result only one duplex of the five planned officers quarters four duplexes and post commandant s house was built by 1844 and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed in his 1844 inspection of the fort colonel george croghan reported that in comparison to other frontier forts he considered fort scott above average
due to the rising tensions that escalated in the mexican american war the us army redeployed troops to the southwest with fort scott still uncompleted officials decided on april 25 1850 that no more construction would be done there after eight years and 35 000 by the time it was finished it was obsolete three years later it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western fort riley
for the average soldier life at the fort was monotonous until the permanent structures were built soldiers had to live in tents which lacked comfort aside from a few whiskey peddlers and prostitutes few civilians lived at the fort officers had brought their personal slaves with them including captain swords five miles east in missouri was a grog shop that supplied soldiers and quite a few courts martial followed soldiers going awol at the shop the desertion rate from the fort ranged from 12 16 due to boredom irregular pay and hatred for military life as no combat took place near the fort it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base hunting was a popular pastime according to captain swords wolf chasing and duck hunting was the only way one officer could tolerate the place
bleeding kansas
two years after the army abandoned the fort the buildings were sold by auction to civilians with two being converted to hotels in 1854 the kansas nebraska act repealed the missouri compromise of 1820 which had kept slavery out of kansas missourians in favor of slavery soon moved to kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not kansas would permit slavery settlers from new england arrived equally determined to keep it out each of the two competing factions of the bleeding kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at fort scott free soil at the fort scott hotel and pro slavery at the western hotel most of the residents in fort scott supported slavery but those outside the town tended to the free soil side during this time there were local incidents of murder and attempted arson typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting
army returns
during the american civil war the fort was renewed as a us military post in august 1861 the union army took command of fort scott and readied it for the war times the united states army also took over several blocks within the town for commissary and quartermaster functions the union army rented the properties from the current civilian owners troops from indiana iowa colorado ohio and wisconsin would come to the fort and either stayed by the fort or traveled farther to subjugate missouri arkansas or the indian territory fort scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the united states colored troops of the union army
a major supply depot was situated at the fort confederate general sterling price hoped to capture the town but the closest the confederate force came to the garrison was 10 miles 16 km away at battle of dry wood creek the site was strategically important as it was within a southern sympathizing area and close to the confederate state of arkansas and the unstable indian territory present day state of oklahoma where many of the members of the five civilized tribes were allied with the confederates the fort served as a general hospital large military hospital and prison until after the war following the end of the war in october 1865 the us army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled
on january 14 1870 the army returned with the formation of the post of southeast kansas the post was based at fort scott but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks and seldom used the original fort they were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers some of the latter feared that the railroad which had been awarded land for development by the us government in rights of way would evict them from their squatter homes the settlers considered the troops lackeys to the railroads and lumped both as enemies
settlers also had some continuing conflicts with indians and insurgents using the recent confederate cause as excuse for robbery by the spring of 1873 the us army withdrew the troops from fort scott for good from 1873 to 1965 the buildings of the fort were left unattended and slowly deteriorated many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use
modern times
with the act of august 31 1965 the national park service gave the city government of fort scott kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort
on october 19 1978 fort scott became a national historic site under the supervision of the national park service encompassing 17 acres 69 000 m2 today the fort is open throughout the year save for thanksgiving christmas and new years day visitation has declined in recent years in 2005 visitation was 25 528 in 2007 it was 22 314
surviving structures include four officers barracks one dragoon s barracks two infantry barracks a hospital guardhouse dragoon stables ordnance and post headquarters quartermaster stables bake shop flagpole and magazine another feature of the park is 5 acres 2 0 ha of tallgrass prairie restored as part of an ecology restoration project

reception
a total of 2 000 people attended slammiversary while the the wrestling observer newsletter reported that 20 000 people bought the event canadian online explorer writer jon waldman rated the entire event a 7 out of 10 which was lower than the 8 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by jason clevett the 7 out of 10 was the same rating given to the 2009 edition by chris and bryan sokol the previous ppv event sacrifice and tna s next ppv event victory road both received a 7 out of 10 by chris sokol and bob kapur respectively compared to rival world wrestling entertainment s wwe one night stand ppv event on june 1 both performed equally as one night stand received the same rating from matt mackinder
waldman felt that tna put on a strong ppv that was in large part to little gimmickery regarding the main event waldman gave it a 6 out of 10 while the world tag team championship match received a 4 out of 10 he gave the six woman tag team match a 4 5 out of 10 and the a j styles versus kurt angle bout a 9 out of 10 the x division championship contest was given a 7 out of 10
wade keller of the pro wrestling torch newsletter reviewed the show he felt the main event had lots of action and drama but that having to hang the belt on a hook does not make for a particularly dramatic end to a match as it seems like someone hanging a plant in the corner than beating someone to win a fight keller said the world tag team championship contest was a solid tag match with some elaborate sequences that were well executed keller stated that the x division championship match was a very good opener regarding the styles and angle bout keller commented that it was a good match but short of a classic must see match in part because there were too many chinlocks mid match from angle that took the crowd out of it
james caldwell also of the pro wrestling torch newsletter posted a review of the show in which he felt the main event was a slow plodding match with an anticlimactic finish caldwell stated that the styles versus angle contest was a fine spotlight singles match but was a bit underwhelming when the expectations were reasonably high for two of tna s best wrestlers in a featured singles match he went on to say that he felt it was missing something and that it seemed like the match just never moved out of second gear caldwell felt the x division championship bout was a very good opening match which could have been a featured match to sell a few additional ppv buys but tna didn t give the x division any focus until the final show before the ppv caldwell stated the world tag team championship was just a slow plodding tag match regarding the marriage segment during the show caldwell said it was just a bad bad bad segment that died slowly and painfully in front of the live audience overall caldwell felt that tna showcased the x division in the opening match but needed more athleticism on the show to balance the slow plodding former wwe heavyweight wrestlers in the main event slots

home made mince pie
home made mince pie is a 1910 american silent short comedy produced by the thanhouser company the film is a comedy of circumstances in which the gale family is going to host a dinner the focus of the humor is in a mince pie that brandy is added to in an attempt to make it more appreciable but three people each add brandy to the pie everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie including the family cat and the film concludes no cast or staff credits for this film are known the film was released on september 27 1910 to mixed reviews in trade publications reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one pie split eight ways would be able to impact everyone the film is presumed lost
plot
though the film is presumed lost a synopsis survives in the moving picture world from september 24 1910 it states life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome and were it not for the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed so the time honored get togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay the gales thought well of this established feature they made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests they were hardly an overly wealthy family and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time
on the night before such an event neither mamma pappa or daughter gale could get those minutes solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests comfort at the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape so little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie the gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie first mamma gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state and give it a stir then pappa gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir finally daughter gale would have to come over and honor it likewise then arrived the guests the minister and the mrs minister they were and some neighbors while she was receiving them the recollection came to mamma gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen she pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor and goes back to her guests then pappa gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored he too excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince no sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than daughter gale who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring rushes in and makes for the whiskey she pours the right proportion in too
production
the writer of the scenario is unknown but it was most likely lloyd lonergan he was an experienced newspaperman employed by the new york evening world while writing scripts for the thanhouser productions the film director is unknown but it may have been barry o neil film historian q david bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production but at least two possible candidates exist blair smith was the first cameraman of the thanhouser company but he was soon joined by carl louis gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer the role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions the cast credits are unknown but many 1910 thanhouser productions are fragmentary in late 1910 the thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films the list includes g w abbe justus d barnes frank h crane irene crane marie eline violet heming martin j faust thomas fortune george middleton grace moore john w noble anna rosemond mrs george walters a surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying eight actors
release and reception
the single reel comedy approximately 1 000 feet long was released on september 27 1910 the film likely had a wide national release with advertisements in theaters known in indiana kansas wisconsin and pennsylvania the film would also be shown in vancouver canada and was met with praise by the audience at the province theatre in 1917 years after the film s release the film was approved without censorship by the pennsylvania state board of censors of moving pictures
the the moving picture world reviewer found the subject to be too long but did not find it to be a fault the reviewer states a domestic comedy with a different flavor in fact with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring neither one knowing that the others have done likewise the humor in this piece centers around this pie what happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination imagine eight people not to speak of the cat getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie we do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week licensed as well as independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters the mince pie episode was well done which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone walton of the moving picture news was not amused by the plot and stated to me the last scene had no humor it was only the necessary ending to the beginning true humor does not emanate from cognac the new york dramatic mirror stated this is the old story of too many cooks and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way the early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation a weak point in the story is the fact that the pie is cut into eight small pieces making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing the character parts are all well taken although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera
back off boogaloo
back off boogaloo is a song by english musician ringo starr released as a non album single in march 1972 starr s former beatles bandmate george harrison produced the recording which took place in london shortly after the two had appeared together at harrison s concert for bangladesh shows in august 1971 the single was a follow up to starr s 1971 hit song it don t come easy and continued his successful run as a solo artist back off boogaloo peaked at number 2 in britain and canada and number 9 on america s billboard hot 100 it remains starr s highest charting single in the united kingdom
the title for the song was inspired by english singer songwriter marc bolan some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at paul mccartney reflecting starr s disdain for the music mccartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years back off boogaloo demonstrates the influence of glam rock on starr who directed a documentary film born to boogie 1972 about bolan s band t rex around this time described by one author as a high energy in your face rocker the song features a prominent slide guitar part by harrison and contributions from musicians gary wright and klaus voormann
starr re recorded back off boogaloo for his 1981 album stop and smell the roses in a collaboration with american singer harry nilsson that incorporates lyrics from beatles songs such as with a little help from my friends good day sunshine and baby you re a rich man the original version has appeared on starr s compilation albums blast from your past and photograph the very best of ringo starr and as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio album goodnight vienna since his return to touring in 1989 starr has performed back off boogaloo regularly in concert with the various incarnations of his all starr band
background and composition
ringo starr identified his initial inspiration for back off boogaloo as having come from marc bolan the singer and guitarist with english glam rock band t rex in a 2001 interview with mojo editor paul du noyer starr described bolan as a dear friend who used to come into the office when i was running apple movies a big office in town and the hang out for myself harry nilsson and keith moon over dinner one evening at starr s home outside london bolan had used the word boogaloo so often that it stuck in starr s mind after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight when discussing the composition on vh1 storytellers in may 1998 starr explained bolan was an energised guy he used to speak back off boogaloo ooh you boogaloo do you want some potatoes ooh you boogaloo starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children s toys that night in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song
the lyrics to the middle eight of back off boogaloo came to starr while watching london weekend television s football show the big match the program s host jimmy hill often referred to a footballer s playing as tasty a catchphrase that starr incorporated into his song lyrics
get yourself together now
and give me something tasty
everything you try to do
you know it sure sounds wasted
commentators have interpreted the song and particularly this statement as an attack by starr on his former beatles bandmate paul mccartney starr has denied any such interpretation instead claiming that the song was inspired by bolan and nothing more beatles biographer robert rodriguez writes starr had publicly criticised mccartney s solo albums mccartney 1970 and ram 1971 on release and author bruce spizer paraphrases the message of the middle eight as a plea for paul to produce better music the mention of sound ing wasted could also be a reference to mccartney s overindulgence with cannabis rodriguez suggests a further example of starr s allegedly anti mccartney message exists in the song s first verse
wake up meathead
don t pretend that you are dead
get yourself up off the cart
the same commentators suggest that here starr could be referring to the 1969 paul is dead hoax the latter rumour circulated during september and october of that year while mccartney hid away on his scottish farm disconsolate after john lennon had told him and starr that he wanted a divorce from the beatles
in addition to these supposed messages in back off boogaloo observers have viewed the song title as starr s rebuke to mccartney to abandon his legal stand against the beatles and apple corps which was placed in receivership in march 1971 after a high court judge found in mccartney s favour author keith badman writes that boogaloo had long been cited as paul s nickname from his former bandmates starr lennon and george harrison while acknowledging that in subsequent years starr might have chosen to minimise any ill feeling towards mccartney rodriguez notes that the lyrics just happened to fit perfectly into the us vs paul mindset following the beatles break up to the extent that back off boogaloo was as damning as early 1970 had been conciliatory when tailoring his 1970 composition i m the greatest for starr to record on the album ringo 1973 lennon referenced the song title with the lines now i m only thirty two and all i want to do is boogaloo
although t rex devotees in the words of starr biographer alan clayson claimed that bolan had ghost written back off boogaloo starr later acknowledged that harrison co wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody as on starr s 1971 hit single it don t come easy harrison was not credited for his songwriting contribution starr originally offered back off boogaloo to fellow liverpudlian cilla black to record but she declined hoping instead to record another new starr harrison composition photograph
recording
having earmarked the song as his next single starr recorded back off boogaloo in september 1971 following his appearance at the harrison organised concert for bangladesh in new york the sessions took place at apple studio in central london with harrison producing as he had on it don t come easy the recording reflects the influence of glam rock on starr through what authors chip madinger and mark easter term its big drum sound and repetitious nature with a line up comprising starr vocals drums percussion harrison guitars gary wright piano and klaus voormann bass saxophone
rodriguez describes starr s martial sounding opening as a rare showcase for his own drumming while harrison biographer simon leng writes of a roaring series of harrison slide breaks that brought to mind duane allman further overdubs included contributions from three backing vocalists led by american soul singer madeline bell
blindman
for the single s b side starr had already written and recorded blindman the theme song for the ferdinando baldi directed spaghetti western of the same name filming for which starr had interrupted in order to perform at the concert for bangladesh starr produced the track with voormann the sessions for blindman took place at apple on 18 19 august with badfinger guitarist pete ham assisting starr and voormann like the film blindman 1971 the song is held in low regard by critics spizer describes it as a muddy sounding dirge with little to recommend
release and reception
apple records issued the single on 17 march 1972 in britain as apple r 5944 with a us release taking place three days later as apple 1849 it was starr s first release since it don t come easy a year before during this period his priority had been to develop a career as an actor in films such as 200 motels 1971 and blindman further aligning himself with britain s glam rock movement starr made his directorial debut with born to boogie 1972 a film starring bolan that included starr s footage of a t rex concert held at wembley on 18 march with back off boogaloo nme critic bob woffinden noted starr s success in establishing himself in the two years since the beatles break up and wrote that the single confirmed that he and harrison dark horses both were the ones who had managed their solo careers more purposefully and intelligently compared with mccartney and lennon
the song was a hit in the us reaching number 9 on the billboard hot 100 and achieved starr s best position on the uk singles chart where it reached number 2 a promotional video for back off boogaloo was shot on 20 march at lennon s tittenhurst park residence while starr was looking after the property the video which shows starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a frankenstein like monster was directed by tom taylor and financed by caravel films a similar monster appeared on the single s picture sleeve holding a cigarette
alan clayson writes of reviewers criticising back off boogaloo for being repetitious leading starr to respond in a 1973 interview play me a pop song that isn t on release chris welch wrote in melody maker a number one hit could easily be in store for the maestro of rock drums there s a touch of the marc bolans in this highly playable rhythmic excursion it s hypnotic and effective ideal for jukeboxes and liable to send us all mad by the end of the week woffinden described the single as every bit as ebullient as it don t come easy although slightly inferior while mike degagne of allmusic views it as a song where t he jovial spirit of ringo starr shines through in a 1974 article for the nme charles shaar murray highlighted back off boogaloo as a great radio and juke box tune
among beatle biographers simon leng terms it a rocking soccer crowd chant that suited starr s talents well and bruce spizer praises the track as a high energy in your face rocker propelled by ringo s thundering drums and george s stinging slide guitar in the 2005 publication nme originals beatles the solo years 1970 1980 paul moody listed back off boogaloo first among starr s ten solo gems and described it as good time rock n droll to match the faces guitar world editor damian fanelli includes the song on his list of harrison s ten best post beatles guitar moments saying of the recording the main event is clearly harrison s slightly wild wacky and very bouncy slide guitar solo which includes an alternate melody line that s even catchier than the melody ringo is singing
re releases for back off boogaloo include starr s 1975 greatest hits album blast from your past and along with blindman as a bonus track on the 1992 reissue of his goodnight vienna album 1974 back off boogaloo also appeared on his 2007 compilation photograph the very best of ringo starr the collector s edition of which included his 1972 video for the song
stop and smell the roses version
starr recorded a new version of back off boogaloo for his 1981 album on boardwalk records stop and smell the roses the song was produced by starr s friend singer harry nilsson and features a musical arrangement by van dyke parks similar to nilsson s 1968 cover of the beatles you can t do that the remake incorporates lyrics from a number of the band s songs in this case with a little help from my friends help lady madonna good day sunshine and baby you re a rich man as well as starr s it don t come easy in a further reference to his past the 1981 version of back off boogaloo opens with the same guitar riff that harrison had played on it don t come easy ten years before
starr taped the basic track at evergreen recording studios in los angeles on 4 november 1980 with additional recording taking place on 1 5 december at nassau s compass point studios among the large cast of musicians supporting starr were nilsson vocals jim keltner drums jane getz piano dennis budimir and richie zito guitars and a four piece horn section led by saxophonist jerry jumonville
starr overdubbed his vocals on 4 december four days before the murder of john lennon who had been due to record his contributions to stop and smell the roses in january 1981 contrasting with his success as a solo artist in 1971 73 the album continued starr s run of commercial and critical failures since 1976 rodriguez writes that m ost people either love or hate the revamping of back off boogaloo
live performance
starr has performed back off boogaloo in concert with his all starr band beginning with the band s debut tour of north america in july september 1989 the song was dropped from the concert setlist early in that tour however in favour of the 1963 lennon mccartney composition i wanna be your man live versions of back off boogaloo have appeared on the multi disc compilation the anthology so far 2001 and king biscuit flower hour presents ringo his new all starr band 2002 the latter version was recorded during a us tour in august 2001 at which point the all starr line up was starr vocals mark rivera saxophone ian hunter guitar roger hodgson and howard jones keyboards greg lake bass and sheila e drums
starr also played the song live with ringo and the roundheads a band he formed to promote his 1998 studio album vertical man a version recorded on 13 may that year at sony music studios new york appeared on starr s vh1 storytellers live album and video released in october 1998 the personnel on this performance included starr vocals joe walsh and mark hudson guitars jack blades bass and simon kirke drums another live version with the roundheads recorded for pbs television s soundstage in august 2005 was issued on ringo starr live at soundstage 2007

where the streets have no name
where the streets have no name is a song by irish rock band u2 it is the opening track from their 1987 album the joshua tree and was released as the album s third single in august 1987 the song s hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect played during the song s introduction and again at the end lead vocalist bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person s religion and income based on the street on which they lived particularly in belfast during the band s difficulties recording the song producer brian eno considered erasing the song s tapes to have them start from scratch
where the streets have no name was praised by critics and became a commercial success peaking at number thirteen in the us number fourteen in canada number ten in the netherlands and number four in the united kingdom the song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on the joshua tree tour the song was performed on a los angeles rooftop for the filming of its music video which won a grammy award for best performance music video
writing and recording
the music for where the streets have no name originated from a demo that guitarist the edge composed the night before the group resumed the joshua tree sessions in an upstairs room at melbeach house his newly purchased home the edge used a four track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards bass guitar and a drum machine realising that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs the edge wanted to conjure up the ultimate u2 live song so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future u2 show if he were a fan after finishing the rough mix he felt he had come up with the most amazing guitar part and song of his life with no one in the house to share the demo with the edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration
although the band liked the demo it was difficult for them to record the song bassist adam clayton said at the time it sounded like a foreign language whereas now we understand how it works the arrangement with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes was rehearsed many times but the group struggled to get a performance they liked according to co producer daniel lanois that was the science project song i remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard as we call them i was holding a pointer like a college professor walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd it was ridiculous co producer brian eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of where the streets have no name the band worked on a single take for weeks but as eno explained that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up through all of their work they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance
so much time had been spent on screwdriver work that eno thought it would be best to start from scratch his idea was to stage an accident and have the song s tapes erased he said that this was not to force abandonment of the song but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance at one point eno had the tapes cued up and ready to be recorded over but this erasure never took place according to engineer flood fellow engineer pat mccarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing eno ready to erase the tapes dropped the tray of tea he was carrying and physically restrained eno
the studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes it was one of several songs mixed by steve lillywhite in the final months of recording the joshua tree drummer larry mullen jr later said of the song it took so long to get that song right it was difficult for us to make any sense of it it only became a truly great song through playing live on the record musically it s not half the song it is live
composition
where the streets have no name is played at a tempo of 126 beats per minute the introduction and outro are played in a 3 4 time signature while the remainder of the song is in a common 4 4 signature the songs opens with an instrumental section starting with chorale like sustained synthesiser notes the guitar fades in after 42 seconds this part consists of a repeated chiming six note arpeggio a dotted eighth delay effect is used to play each note in the arpeggio twice thus creating a rich sound the bass and drums enter at 1 10
the introduction following a i iv i iv vi v i chord progression creates a wall of sound as described by mark butler against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes the guitar part played for the remainder of the song features the edge strumming percussive sixteenth notes the bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes respectively while bono s vocal performance in contrast varies greatly in its timbre he sighs he moans he grunts he exhales audibly he allows his voice to crack as well as timing by his usage of rubato to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat
this development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line burning down love a g f d the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song the a4 at burning in later choruses bono sings blown by the wind with the same melody stretching the same note even longer after the third chorus the song s outro is played the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction with a six note guitar arpeggio played against sustained synthesiser notes
lyrics
the lyrics were inspired by a story that bono heard about the streets of belfast northern ireland where a person s religion and income are evident by the street they live on he contrasted this with the anonymity he felt when visiting ethiopia saying the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren t such divisions a place where the streets have no name to me that s the way a great rock n roll concert should be a place where everyone comes together maybe that s the dream of all art to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to ethiopia with his wife ali hewson he first wrote them down on an airsickness bag while staying in a village
according to him the song is ostensibly about transcendence elevation whatever you want to call it bono who compared many of his lyrics prior to the joshua tree to sketches said that where the streets have no name is more like the u2 of old than any of the other songs on the lp because it s a sketch i was just trying to sketch a location maybe a spiritual location maybe a romantic location i was trying to sketch a feeling
the open ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations journalist michael campbell believed the lyrics send a message of hope and wish for a world that is not divided by class wealth race or any other arbitrary criterion with regard to the place bono was referring to in the song he said i m not sure really about that i used to think it was belfast journalist niall stokes believes the title was influenced by bono s and his wife ali s visit to ethiopia as volunteer aid workers bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open ended lyrics i can look at it now and recognize that the song has one of the most banal couplets in the history of pop music but it also contains some of the biggest ideas in a curious way that seems to work if you get any way heavy about these things you don t communicate but if you re flip or throwaway about it then you do that s one of the paradoxes i ve come to terms with
release
originally the third single from the joshua tree was meant to be the song red hill mining town but where the streets have no name was released instead in august 1987 the single was released on 7 inch 12 inch cassette and cd single formats three b sides were featured on the single including race against time silver and gold and sweetest thing except for the 7 inch release which only featured the latter two tracks the 12 inch single featured race against time on side a of the record despite being a b side and the cassette single featured all four tracks on both sides of the tape although not as successful as the album s first two singles the song did chart well in the u s the song peaked at number 13 on the billboard hot 100 and number 11 on the album rock tracks charts the song reached number four on the uk singles chart and it topped the irish singles chart
music video
the video begins with an aerial shot of a block in los angeles and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc jockeys stating that u2 is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of 30 000 people police show up to the set and inform the band s crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance two minutes into the video u2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th ave and s main st and perform where the streets have no name to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building towards the end of the song the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are booing the police
the video for where the streets have no name was directed by meiert avis and produced by michael hamlyn and ben dossett the band attracted over 1 000 people during the video s filming which took place on the rooftop of a liquor store in downtown los angeles on 27 march 1987 the band s performance on a rooftop in a public place was a reference to the beatles final concert as depicted in the film let it be
during the shoot u2 played an eight song set which included four performances of where the streets have no name prior to filming a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be intruded by a group of fans a backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator which happened during filming
the depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming just as seen in the video hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police according to avis the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day almost in real time and that getting busted was an integral part of the plan band manager paul mcguinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to dramatize the music video but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video in the background of the video is a sign for the million dollar hotel which was rebuilt to create some interest in case no one showed up at the film shoot although the video is of a live performance the audio used is from the studio recorded version of the song the video won the grammy award for best performance music video at the 1989 grammy awards
b sides
race against time was released on the 12 inch cassette and cd versions of the single the song developed from the band s interest in urban funk and was described by the edge as a kind of afro rhythmic piece and a study in rhythm the bass riff in the song inspired by the bodhr n was played by the edge but stemmed from some of clayton s unused bass parts mullen s drum part was recorded in a single take the song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by bono s trip to ethiopia after live aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence these lyrical references include bono singing in an ethiopian language and following it with the phrase race against time bono said of the song it reminds me of the desert the desert is so empty but it aches with a strange kind of fullness john hutchinson of musician magazine described the song as having an african flavour and as being reminiscent of peter gabriel the track was used in the miami vice episode child s play and is the only one of the single s b sides that was never played live
silver and gold was written in support of the artists united against apartheid project which protested the south african apartheid in 1985 bono participated in steven van zandt s anti apartheid sun city project and spent time with keith richards and mick jagger of the rolling stones when richards and jagger played blues bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre as most of u2 s musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid 1970s bono realised that u2 had no tradition and he felt as if they were from outer space this inspired him to write the blues influenced song silver and gold which he recorded with richards and ronnie wood it was re recorded by u2 for the where the streets have no name single while the band returned to dublin during in may 1987 during a break between the first and second legs of the joshua tree tour the song was described by musician as tough and raw with bono in husky and confident voice underpinned by a sinuous bass line and with the edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues based guitar silver and gold was played live on the joshua tree tour several times one performance of which was featured on the band s 1988 album and rockumentary rattle and hum both the studio recording and the sun city versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of the joshua tree the studio version was also included on the limited edition b sides bonus disk of the band s first compilation album the best of 1980 1990
sweetest thing was written by bono as an apology to his wife for forgetting her birthday the song opens with a short piano piece before the rest of the band begins to play some of bono s lyrics have been described as reminiscent of john lennon the edge described it as a beautiful song which is pop as it should be not produced out of existence but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity also noting that it s very new for us it was re recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in 1998 as a single in its own right for the best of 1980 1990 hot press editor niall stokes stated that this track along with race against time is an indicator of what u2 might have made instead of the joshua tree
critical reception
upon the release of the joshua tree critics praised where the streets have no name steve morse of the boston globe noted the bell like tones from the edge fram e a search for heaven and along with the subsequent track on the album i still haven t found what i m looking for these songs showed how the group were pilgrims still on a quest not preachers who claim to have found answers the bergen record echoed these sentiments saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest rolling stone called it assertive rock in their review of the joshua tree the san diego union tribune said of where the streets have no name the music charges like someone fleeing for life the washington post said the track is a bit oblique lyrically but the implications are clear in bono s resolute delivery dave the edge evan s quavering guitar adam clayton s cathedral bass and larry mullen s rolling thunder drums
nme lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album starts by spitting furiously the publication praised bono s impassioned singing and the edge s guitar playing which transformed the instrument into something more than an endlessly abused piece of wood the review commented that the last ten seconds are breathtakingly beautiful the rocket wrote that the song builds a wall of sound that bono s vocals cut through with a wail of desperation as the lyrics agonize the need for personal spirituality the reviewer compared the opening riff to simple minds ghostdancing reviewing the joshua tree stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic called the song an epic opener the service s steve huey in a review of the song praised its insistent propulsive rhythmic drive and anthemic chorus qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite he called the song the perfect album opener crediting the slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak huey also called bono s delivery passionate and grandiose and his commitment to the material unshakable he believed the combination of his vocals and the band s sonic power is what gave u2 its tremendous force
live performances
where the streets have no name made its concert debut on 2 april 1987 in tempe arizona on the opening night of the joshua tree tour it has since been played at nearly every full length concert that u2 has headlined totaling over 700 performances as of 2011 the song is widely regarded as one of the group s most popular live songs bono said of it we can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives but when we go into that song everything changes the audience is on its feet singing along with every word it s like god suddenly walks through the room
on the joshua tree tour where the streets have no name was most often used to open concerts fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting the san diego union tribune wrote that from the lofty sonic opening strains of the song this audience was up ecstatic and inflamed nme wrote that the song is one such occasion where the power afforded their songs is scary noting that during the song s opening the arena erupts in other reviews the song was called uplifting exhilarating and powerful out of the 109 shows during the joshua tree tour streets was played at all except 12 of the concerts during the lovetown tour which took place in 1989 and the beginning of 1990 streets was only left out of the set list at one of the 47 concerts
the song was performed at every show on the 1992 1993 zoo tv tour concerts from this tour were elaborate multimedia spectacles that bono performed as a variety of characters but for the end of the main set the group reverted to playing classics including where the streets have no name straight some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from the joshua tree s photo shoot the video was speeded up for humorous effect nme described the effect as giving it a silly charlie chaplin quality and bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens this video would make a return during performances on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the u2 360 tour some of the zoo tv performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the pet shop boys synthpop cover of the song titled where the streets have no name i can t take my eyes off you bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the pet shop boys cover critics welcomed the song in the group s setlist the independent said the song induces instant euphoria as u2 do what they re best at slipping into epic rock mode playing music made for the arena in two other local newspaper reviews critics praised the song s inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits
for the popmart tour of 1997 1998 u2 returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the zoo tv tour the set s massive video screen displayed a video that hot press described as an astonishing 2001 style trip into the heart of a swirling psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal monolith near the end of the song peace doves were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set s golden arch were projected upwards hot press said the effect transformed the stadium into a ufo landing site
shortly before the third leg of the elevation tour the september 11 attacks occurred in new york city and washington d c during the band s first show in new york city following the attacks the band performed where the streets have no name and when the stage lights illuminated the audience the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans the experience was one inspiration for the song city of blinding lights the band paid tribute to the 9 11 victims during their performance of the song at the super bowl xxxvi halftime show on 3 february 2002 the performance featured the names of the september 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band u2 s appearance was later ranked number 1 on sports illustrated s list of top 10 super bowl halftime shows
for the vertigo tour the group originally considered dropping the song from their setlists but mullen and clayton successfully argued against this all 131 of the vertigo tour concerts featured a performance of the song which were accompanied by the stage s led video curtains displaying african flags on the tour s opening night this reminded bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an ethiopian village he thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle saying and here it was nearly twenty years later coming back to africa all the stuff about parched lands and deserts making sense for the first time the song was also played at the preview screening of the band s concert film u2 3d at the 2007 cannes film festival at the glastonbury festival 2010 the edge accompanied rock band muse for a live cover version of the track later playing it with u2 while headlining glastonbury in 2011
live performances of where the streets have no name appear in the concert video releases rattle and hum zoo tv live from sydney and popmart live from mexico city as well as the respective audio releases of the latter two concerts zoo tv live and hasta la vista baby u2 live from mexico city a second version from the popmart tour was featured on please popheart live ep and later on the u s please single a live recording from boston during the elevation tour was featured in the concert film elevation 2001 live from boston and on the walk on and electrical storm singles the concert video and album u2 go home live from slane castle ireland featured another performance from the elevation tour and later performances were featured in the concert films vertigo 2005 live from chicago and u2 3d vertigo tour and u2 360 at the rose bowl u2 360 tour the 2004 digital album live from the point depot contains a performance from the lovetown tour only available as part of the complete u2 digital box set
legacy

nazarov cyclization reaction
the nazarov cyclization reaction often referred to as simply the nazarov cyclization is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of cyclopentenones the reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants depending on the reagents and substrates employed it was originally discovered by ivan nikolaevich nazarov 1906 1957 in 1941 while studying the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones
as originally described the nazarov cyclization involves the activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric lewis acid or protic acid promoter the key step of the reaction mechanism involves a cationic 4 electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product see mechanism below as the reaction has been developed variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than lewis acids have been subsumed under the name nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway
the success of the nazarov cyclization as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products including jasmone the aflatoxins and a subclass of prostaglandins and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis the reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published
mechanism
the mechanism of the classical nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocyclization and is outlined below activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation which undergoes a thermally allowed 4 conrotatory electrocyclization as dictated by the woodward hoffman rules this generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a hydrogen subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product
as noted above variants that deviate from this template are known what designates a nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation in order to achieve this transformation the molecule must be in the s trans s trans conformation placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation the propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate with substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain coordination of an electron donating substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation
similarly substitution directed inward restricts the s trans conformation so severely that e z isomerization has been shown to occur in advance of cyclization on a wide range of substrates yielding the trans cyclopentenone regardless of initial configuration in this way the nazarov cyclization is a rare example of a stereoselective pericyclic reaction whereas most electrocyclizations are stereospecific the example below uses triethylsilyl hydride to trap the oxyallyl cation so that no elimination occurs see interrupted cyclizations below
along this same vein allenyl vinyl ketones of the type studied extensively by marcus tius of the university of hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of hydrogens obviating a large amount of steric strain in the s cis conformer
classical nazarov cyclizations
though cyclizations following the general template above had been observed prior to nazarov s involvement it was his study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product the reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone
research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years until in the mid 1980s when several syntheses employing the nazarov cyclization were published shown below are key steps in the syntheses of trichodiene and nor sterepolide the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne allene isomerization that generates the divinyl ketone
shortcomings
the classical version of the nazarov cyclization suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to circumvent the first two are not evident from the mechanism alone but are indicative of the barriers to cyclization the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and protonation of the intermediate
strong lewis or protic acids are typically required for the reaction e g ticl4 bf3 meso3h these promoters are not compatible with sensitive functional groups limiting the substrate scope
despite the mechanistic possibility for catalysis multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction this limits the atom economy of the reaction
the elimination step is not regioselective if multiple hydrogens are available for elimination various products are often observed as mixtures this is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as arduous separation is typically required
elimination destroys a potential stereocenter decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction
protonation of the enolate is sometimes not stereoselective meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of epimers
modern variants
the shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form however modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research in particular the research has focused on a few key areas rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step and improving the overall stereoselectivity these have been successful to varying degrees
additionally modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction either by generating the pentadienyl cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxyallyl cation intercepted in various ways furthermore enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed the sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field key examples are given below
silicon directed cyclization
the earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the nazarov cyclization took advantage of the silicon effect in order to direct the regioselectivity of the elimination step this chemistry was developed most extensively by professor scott denmark of the university of illinois urbana champaign in the mid 1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron trichloride to promote the reaction with bicyclic products the cis isomer was selected for to varying degrees
the silicon directed nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product silphinene shown below the cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether
polarization
drawing on the substituent effects compiled over various trials of the reaction professor alison frontier of the university of rochester developed a paradigm for polarized nazarov cyclizations in which electron donating and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction creation of an effective vinyl nucleophile and vinyl electrophile in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper triflate and regioselective elimination in addition the electron withdrawing group increases the acidity of the proton allowing selective formation of the trans epimer via equilibration
it is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a donating or withdrawing group alone although the efficiency of the reaction yield reaction time etc is typically lower
alternative cation generation
by extension any pentadienyl cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a nazarov cyclization there have been a large number of examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements one such example involves the silver catalyzed cationic ring opening of allylic dichloro cylopropanes the silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride
in the total synthesis of rocaglamide epoxidation of a vinyl alkoxyallenyl stannane likewise generates a pentadienyl cation via ring opening of the resultant epoxide
interrupted cyclization
once the cyclization has occurred an oxyallyl cation is formed as discussed extensively above the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization however these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles respectively oxyallyl cation trapping has been developed extensively by fredrick g west of the university of alberta and his review covers the field the oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity
enolate trapping with various electrophiles is decidedly less common in one study the nazarov cyclization is paired with a michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to nitrostyrene in this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions it acts as the lewis acid in the nazarov cyclization and in the next step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the r group
enantioselective variants
the development of an enantioselective nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of nazarov cyclization reactions to that end several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts diastereoselective cyclizations are also known in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of torquoselectivity selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to rotate in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below
silicon directed nazarov cyclizations can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way in the example below the silyl group acts to direct the cyclization by preventing the distant alkene from rotating towards it via unfavorable steric interaction in this way the silicon acts as a traceless auxiliary the starting material is not enantiopure but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the cyclization
tius s allenyl substrates can exhibit axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used the example below generates a chiral diosphenpol in 64 yield and 95 enantiomeric excess
tius has additionally developed a camphor based auxiliary for achiral allenes that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of roseophilin the key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro 2 propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent
the first chiral lewis acid promoted asymmetric nazarov cyclization was reported by varinder aggarwal and utilized copper ii bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98 ee the enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50 mol of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased
related reactions
extensions of the nazarov cyclization are generally also subsumed under the same name for example an unsaturated ketone can undergo a similar cationic conrotatory cyclization that is typically referred to as an iso nazarov cyclization reaction other such extensions have been given similar names including homo nazarov cyclizations and vinylogous nazarov cyclizations
retro nazarov reaction
because they overstabilize the pentadienyl cation electron donating substiuents often severely impede nazarov cyclization building from this several electrocyclic ring openings of alkoxy cyclopentanes have been reported these are typically referred to as retro nazarov cyclization reactions
imino nazarov reaction
nitrogen analogues of the nazarov cyclization reaction known as imino nazarov cyclization reactions have few instances there is one example of a generalized imino nazarov cyclization reported shown below and several iso imino nazarov reactions in the literature even these tend to suffer from poor stereoselectivity poor yields or narrow scope the difficulty stems from the relative over stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation impeding cyclization
horrible bosses
horrible bosses is a 2011 american black comedy film directed by seth gordon written by michael markowitz john francis daley and jonathan goldstein based on a story by markowitz it stars jason bateman charlie day jason sudeikis jennifer aniston colin farrell kevin spacey and jamie foxx the plot follows three friends played by bateman day and sudeikis who decide to murder their respective overbearing abusive bosses portrayed by spacey aniston and farrell
markowitz s script was bought by new line cinema in 2005 and the film spent six years in various states of pre production with a variety of actors attached to different roles by 2010 goldstein and daley had rewritten the script and the film finally went into production
the film premiered in los angeles on june 30 2011 and received a wide release on july 8 2011 the film exceeded financial expectations accruing over 28 million in the first three days making it the number two film in the united states during its opening weekend and going on to become the highest grossing black comedy film of all time in unadjusted dollars breaking the record previously set by the war of the roses in 1990 the film grossed over 209 million worldwide during its theatrical run
the film opened to positive critical reception with several critics praising the ensemble cast with each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews the plot received a more mixed response some reviewers felt that its dark humorous premise was explored well while others felt the jokes were racist homophobic and misogynistic a sequel horrible bosses 2 was released on november 26 2014
plot
nick hendricks bateman and dale arbus day are friends who despise their bosses nick works at a financial firm for the sadistic david harken spacey who implies the possibility of a promotion for nick for months only to award it to himself dale is a dental assistant being sexually harassed by his boss dr julia harris aniston she threatens to tell his fiancee stacy lindsay sloane that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her nick and dale s accountant friend kurt buckman sudeikis enjoys working for jack pellitt donald sutherland at a chemical company but after jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack the company is taken over by jack s cocaine addicted son bobby farrell whose apathy and incompetence threaten the future of the company
at night over drinks kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer around initially hesitant they eventually agree to kill their employers in search of a hitman the trio meet dean motherfuckah jones foxx an ex con who agrees to be their murder consultant jones suggests that dale kurt and nick kill each other s bosses to hide their motive while making the deaths look like accidents
the three reconnoiter bobby s house and kurt steals bobby s phone they next go to harken s house where kurt and nick go inside while dale waits in the car harken returns home and confronts dale for littering but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter on the litter dale saves harken by stabbing him with an epipen nick and kurt think dale is stabbing harken to death and flee with kurt accidentally dropping bobby s phone in harken s bedroom the next night kurt watches julia s home but she seduces and has sex with him nick and dale reluctantly wait outside bobby s and harken s houses respectively to commit the murders despite neither of them wanting to harken discovers bobby s cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address suspecting his wife rhonda julie bowen is having an affair he drives over and kills bobby with nick as a secret witness
nick flees at high speed setting off a traffic camera the trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan they are arrested by the police who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in bobby s murder lacking evidence the police are forced to let the trio go free the trio consult with jones again but learn that he never actually killed anyone having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film snow falling on cedars jones suggests that they get harken to confess and secretly tape it the three accidentally crash harken s surprise birthday party where nick and dale get harken to confess to the murder before realizing that kurt who has the audio recorder is elsewhere having sex with rhonda harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him they flee by car but harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle believing they have committed a crime the car s navigation system operator remotely disables kurt s car allowing harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness
the police arrest nick dale and kurt but the navigation system operator gregory reveals that it is his companies policy to record all conversations for quality assurance gregory plays the tape that has harken confessing he murdered pellitt harken is sentenced to 25 years to life in prison while the friends get their charges waived nick is promoted to president of the company under a sadistic ceo kurt retains his job under a new boss and dale blackmails julia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass a supposedly unconscious patient while jones secretly records the act
cast
jason bateman as nick hendricks
an executive at a financial firm who is manipulated into jumping through hoops in order to get a promotion that his boss never intended to give him markowitz wrote the role specifically for bateman
charlie day as dale arbus
a dental assistant who is sexually harassed by his boss described as a hopeless romantic in love with his fianc e ashton kutcher was in talks for the role at two different points in the lengthy production day was considered for the role following his co starring performance with sudeikis in the 2010 film going the distance reuters reported that industry insiders believed his performance overshadowed the main stars
jason sudeikis as kurt buckman
an account manager at a chemical company dealing with a new drug addicted boss after his beloved former boss dies sudeikis was cast in may 2010
jennifer aniston as dr julia harris d d s
markowitz based the character on a former boss claiming she was very sexually aggressive with everybody when writing the script markowitz intended for the role to go to aniston he stated but the aforementioned boss looked more like cruella de vil it was like flirting with a cobweb so i decided for the sake of the movie let s go with jennifer aniston the actress insisted on wearing a brown wig for the role wanting to look different from other characters she had played
colin farrell as bobby pellitt
described as a weaselly scion and a corrupt and incompetent jerk who s in charge of things but clearly has no idea what he s doing farrell explained the motivation he gave to the character stating this guy thinks he s god s gift to women god s gift to intellect to humor to the club scene to everything it s all part of his grandiose sense of self esteem which is probably masking a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with kurt and all kinds of other things with pellit seth gave me complete license to act as pathologically screwed up as possible farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character suggesting the comb over hairstyle pot belly and an affinity for chinese dragons
kevin spacey as david harken
president of comnidyne industries tom cruise philip seymour hoffman and jeff bridges had been approached by new line cinema to take the role described as a psychopathic master manipulator with an attractive wife spacey signed up for the role in june 2010 the part was considered integral to the film gordon commented that the character was an amalgamation of several real bosses rather than one single person to avoid being sued
jamie foxx as dean motherfuckah jones
the character had the more colorful name cocksucker jones but it was changed at foxx s request with producer jay stern commenting that foxx felt it was over the line the current name was said to be subject to further change prior to the release of the film foxx contributed to his character s appearance suggesting full scalp tattoos and a retro clothing style foxx described the appearance as a guy who maybe went to jail for a minute and now he s living in his own time capsule when he got out he went right back to the clothes he thought were hot when he went in
during the six year development of the film several actors were in negotiations to star including owen wilson vince vaughn matthew mcconaughey ryan reynolds dax shepard and johnny knoxville
donald sutherland portrays jack pellitt bobby s father and kurt s boss on july 27 2010 isaiah mustafa was confirmed as joining the cast mustafa was quoted as saying it s a smaller role he appears as officer wilkens julie bowen appears in the film as rhonda harken s wife bowen stated that her character may or may not be a hussy the character described as intentionally making her husband jealous ioan gruffudd has a cameo as a male prostitute erroneously hired as a hitman lindsay sloane appears as dale s fiancee stacy p j byrne plays kenny sommerfeld a former investment manager now scrounging for drinks while wendell pierce and ron white play a pair of cops bob newhart makes a cameo as sadistic comnidyne ceo louis sherman john francis daley a screenwriter on the film cameos as nick s co worker carter
production
development
markowitz s script for horrible bosses was sold at auction to new line cinema by ratner s production company rat entertainment in 2005 for a six figure amount ratner initially was interested in directing but became occupied with directing the comedy tower heist frank oz and david dobkin were in talks to direct jonathan goldstein and john francis daley rewrote the script in 2010 and the project went into production with seth gordon directing
design
production designer shepherd frankel specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses homes and offices nick and harken s workplace is the comnidyne bullpen which was designed to enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office the design team met with financial strategists and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low ranking position in a cubicle and aspiring to an office costume designer carol ramsey worked with frankel and set decorator jan pascale to match harken s suit to that of the surrounding cold grey and blue color palette of his office harken s home was described as equally lacking in warmth as the office but more lavishly decorated and for show including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his trophy wife
designing julia s office was described as a challenge infusing a sensual vibe into a dental office frankel approached the design through julia s mentality stating she s a type a professional at the top of her game who likes to play cat and mouse so it s a completely controlled environment with apertures and views into other rooms so she always knows what s going on it s highly designed with rich wallpaper and tones sumptuous artwork and subtle lighting all very disarming till you step into her private office the blinds close the door locks and you think it s the temple of doom similarly approaching the character s home the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she couldn t get away with at work
bobby s environments were designed with more contrast the character being new to the work area frankel described the contrast as the company reflects jack pellitt s human touch whereas bobby pellitt s home is a shameless shrine to himself and his hedonistic appetites frankel continued it features a mishmash of anything he finds exotic and erotic mostly egyptian and asian motifs with an 80s studio 54 vibe a makeshift dojo lots of mirrors and a massage table some parts of the house design were provided by farrell and gordon s interpretation of the character and his infatuation with martial arts and his delusions of prowess
filming
filming of horrible bosses took place in and around los angeles the production team attempted to find locations that people haven t already seen a hundred times in movies and on tv aiming for the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere in america where people are trying to pursue the american dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss comnidyine was represented by an office building in torrance california with the crew building the set on a vacant floor for pellitt chemical the production team found a perfect landscape of pipes and containers in santa fe springs surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility to take advantage of the surrounding imagery the warehouse required an extensive series of overhauls including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new doorways to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of sutherland s character a t g i friday s in woodland hills los angeles was used as a bar frequented by nick dale and kurt while the bar scene where they meet with jones was staged in downtown los angeles
the film was shot digitally using the panavision genesis camera gordon encouraged the actors to improvise though aniston claimed to not have taken advantage of the offer as much as her co stars stating my dialogue was just so beautifully choreographed that there wasn t much that i needed to do
music
the soundtrack was composed by award winning composer christopher lennertz with music contributed by mike mccready of pearl jam stefan lessard of dave matthews band and money mark a collaborator with the beastie boys mccready lessard and mark worked with musicians matt chamberlain david levita aaron kaplan victor indrizzo chris chaney davey chegwidden and dj cheapshot to develop the music major contributions were provided by mark on keyboard mccready and levita on guitar chaney and lessard on bass indrizzo on drums and dj cheapshot on turntables
lennertz recorded the soundtrack at the village recording studio in west los angeles and capitol records lennertz attempted to remain authentic to the characters progression from average worker to calculated killer to achieve this aim he decided against recording digitally instead recording the tracks on two inch analog tape intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record he explained the idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album it isn t over produced or shiny and digital in any way it s brash noisy and full of bravado and swagger i knew that if we could harness some of this sonic magic in the score then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against bateman sudeikis and charlie day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire lennertz continued we tracked through tape before pro tools to get that fat sound and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection we even used the same wurlitzer that money mark played on beck s classic where it s at at the end of the day seth gordon and i wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself i think we did it and most of all everyone had a blast in the process
horrible bosses the original motion picture soundtrack was released in physical and digital formats on july 5 2011 by watertower music the soundtrack consists of 33 tracks with a runtime of 63 minutes

critical reception
horrible bosses received generally positive reviews from critics on rotten tomatoes the film holds a rating of 68 based on 208 reviews with an average rating of 6 2 10 the site s critical consensus reads it s nasty uneven and far from original but thanks to a smartly assembled cast that makes the most of a solid premise horrible bosses works review aggregate metacritic gave the film a score of 57 out of 100 based on 40 critics indicating mixed or average reviews
roger ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four calling it well cast and commending it for playing to each actor s strengths ebert gave particular praise to spacey labeling him superb and aniston judging her performance to be a surprise and a return to form stating she has acute comic timing and hilariously enacts alarming sexual hungers ebert called horrible bosses cheerful and wicked lisa schwarzbaum of entertainment weekly reacted positively calling the film a bouncy well built delightfully nasty tale of resentment desperation and amoral revenge and complimented the casting of the protagonists and antagonists the a v club s nathan rabin also praised the cast stating that the picture succeeds almost entirely on the chemistry of its three leads who remain likeable even while resorting to homicide adding the acting more than compensates for the film s other failings rabin singled out day s performance as a potent illustration of how a brilliant character actor with a spark of madness can elevate a ramshackle lowbrow farce into a solid mainstream comedy through sheer force of charisma edward douglas of comingsoon net credited director seth gordon with having assembled the perfect cast claiming the six leads kill in every scene but echoed nathan rabin s sentiments that day is the real standout douglas summarized the picture as dark fun that works better than expected due to a well developed script an impeccable cast and a director who knows how to put the two together a o scott of the new york times stated the timing of the cast is impeccable and appreciated that the script did not attempt to cut its coarseness with a hypocritical dose of sweetness or respectability the review concluded that in the ways that count and even when it shouldn t horrible bosses works
usa today s scott bowles awarded the film three out of four stars labeling it a surprising comedy that rivals bridesmaids as the funniest film of the summer if not the year bowles added that the characters are so likable giving particular credit to sudeikis though also adding praise for the performances of bateman and day the dialogue was also lauded by bowles which commented that seth gordon has a deft touch with water cooler talk even when the water cooler might be spiked with poison leonard maltin of indiewire considered day to have had the breakout role and offered praise to the performances of the cast but lamented the lack of screen time for farrell s character maltin concluded the movie has just enough raunchiness to identify it as a 2011 comedy just enough cleverness to admire and just the right camaraderie among its three male stars which turns out to be the movie s greatest strength rolling stone s peter travers gave kudos to the killer cast with specific credit given to bateman and day but was critical of the movie stating it wussies out on a sharp premise and that it is a hit and miss farce that leaves you wishing it was funnier than it is the guardian s philip french called horrible bosses a lumbering misogynistic affair but admitted i laughed frequently probably to the detriment of my self respect nicholas barber of the independent gave a positive review complimenting gordon for not allowing the actors improvisation to be detrimental to the pacing but felt the movie was not as dark as its premise required saying what edginess the film does have comes instead from the inordinate quantity of swearing plus a smattering of homophobia and misogyny
salon s andrew o hehir offered a mixed response characterizing the film as a lot funnier in theory than in practice but it won t ruin your saturday night salon appreciated the effortless comic chemistry between sudeikis bateman and day and singled out bateman aniston and spacey for their performances o hehir was however critical of the perceived homophobia sexism and racism the hollywood reporter s kirk honeycutt responded negatively stating the jokes failed to be funny stating seth gordon shows no flair for turning the absurdities and cartoonish characters in the script into anything more than a collection of moments in search of laughs karina longworth of the village voice was critical of the premise which she felt lacked any legitimate rage against the characters bosses stating there s every sign that even without these particular emasculators dale kurt and nick would still be for lack of a better word total pussies longworth felt that the humor was rarely actually laugh out loud funny and never truly dark or daring she particularly criticized the all white male protagonists and a plot she deemed racist and filled with stereotypes justin chang of variety praised the performance of the ensemble cast but considered the plot to be predictably moronic vulgar and juvenile chang echoed the sentiments of the village voice in lamenting that the film failed to pursue the premise to darker more daring territory and faulted it for falling back on over the top comic exaggeration

1985 rajneeshee assassination plot
the 1985 rajneeshee assassination plot was a conspiracy by a group of high ranking followers of bhagwan shree rajneesh later known as osho to assassinate charles turner the then united states attorney for the district of oregon rajneesh s personal secretary and second in command ma anand sheela sheela silverman assembled the group after turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at rajneeshpuram turner investigated charges of immigration fraud and sham marriages and later headed the federal prosecution of the 1984 rajneeshee bioterror attack in the dalles oregon
the conspirators included ma anand sheela sally anne croft chief financial officer of rajneeshpuram susan hagan head of security at rajneeshpuram catherine jane stork who bought weapons and silencers and volunteered to be the actual murderer ann phyllis mccarthy fourth in command of rajneeshpuram and co conspirators alma potter carol matthews phyllis caldwell and richard kevin langford the conspirators obtained false identification to purchase handguns out of state stalked turner and planned to murder him near his workplace in portland oregon the assassination plot was never carried out and was only discovered later as a result of the investigation by federal law enforcement into the bioterror attack in the dalles and other illegal acts by the rajneeshpuram leadership
prosecution of the conspirators began in 1990 when a federal grand jury brought indictments against several of the key players some had fled the country and extradition proceedings against the perpetrators and subsequent prosecution and conviction was not completed for sixteen years the final conspirator was convicted in 2006 when catherine jane stork agreed to return to the united states from germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in australia eight perpetrators received sentences ranging from five years probation to five years in federal prison and an additional member of the rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy rajneesh was never prosecuted in relation to the conspiracy and left the united states after pleading guilty to immigration fraud and agreeing not to reenter the country without permission from the u s attorney general

hit list

in may 1985 rajneesh s personal secretary and second in command sheela silverman ma anand sheela gathered the leader s key followers and formed a group of conspirators in order to plan the assassination of turner as well as several dissidents among their organization sheela stated that turner s grand jury investigation threatened the existence of the commune and exposed rajneesh and several of his disciples to criminal prosecution sheela hoped that by murdering turner they would be able to thwart the federal immigration investigation which could have resulted in deportation of rajneeshee leaders three former leaders of the commune including ma anand sheela dianne yvonne onang ma anand puja a registered nurse from the philippines who managed the rajneeshee medical corporation and former treasurer of rajneesh foundation international and catherine jane stork ma shanti bhadra of australia put together a hit list which included u s attorney charles turner and oregon attorney general david frohnmayer

weapons
catherine jane stork volunteered to be the follower who would actually murder turner and bought guns and silencers stork was known to fellow followers as ma shanti bhadra and was also one of the three big mammas in rajneeshpuram sally anne croft known by followers as ma prem savita an accountant and the group s chief financial officer provided money for the purchase of weapons related to the plot phyllis caldwell ma deva ritka described in a federal affidavit how members of the murder conspiracy obtained handguns referring to catherine jane stork and sally anne croft shanti b went down to jesus grove and savita gave us several thousand dollars to use to buy guns jesus grove referred to a group of trailers where all the leaders of the rajneesh commune resided except for bhagwan shree rajneesh
ma anand sheela and three other rajneesh followers traveled to new york in the spring of 1985 to acquire false identification according to a federal indictment the perpetrators of the assassination plot used a false birth certificate to purchase guns two members of the group then traveled to texas to purchase handguns caldwell stated she and catherine jane stork flew to texas to purchase guns there they purchased five guns in texas but encountered difficulty purchasing handguns in texas with out of state identification and traveled to new mexico instead caldwell said they called back to the commune but the women were instructed not to come back without the guns
in new mexico they obtained false identification and purchased several pistols their intention was to purchase guns which were difficult to trace caldwell said it was easy to obtain guns in new mexico we found it was pretty easy to buy guns all you had to do was show some identification and it was easy to get caldwell said she and stork went to a university library to find the identity of someone dying very young next went to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate and described how we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt and then we were able to go to several different gun shops in albuquerque with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets said caldwell they were able to obtain one colt 38 caliber revolver and four ruger 357 caliber security six magnum revolvers the conspirators smuggled the guns into oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a greyhound lines bus caldwell said that she and stork traveled by bus back to the rajneesh commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors
surveillance
after obtaining guns the conspirators returned to portland oregon they rented out an apartment in portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of turner rajneesh follower carol matthews ma prem samadhi used a fake name during the planning of the assassination plot in an attempt to obtain the home address of charles turner according to federal prosecutors matthews obtained a college yearbook of turner s and learned his car s license plate number and his parking location court records state that matthews and an unindicted co conspirator gave voter registration officials fake identities and told officials they were conducting a voter survey on president reagan s economic plan in order to obtain turner s route number and post office box number the two tried repeating the story with members of the u s postal service but the postal officials did not give them turner s address they then drove around turner s neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said turner matthews had pictures of turner s residence developed these were later obtained by the federal bureau of investigation fbi during an investigation of the rajneesh commune and verified after being shown to turner
members of the group of conspirators watched turner s office home and car and discussed methods to assassinate him hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into rajneeshpuram their plan was to shoot turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked in portland oregon but the conspirators also debated whether to murder turner in downtown portland or closer to his home after spending multiple nights watching turner s house the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work or in front of his home turner had a reserved parking spot in a federal garage underneath terry schrunk plaza in portland oregon in an affidavit given to the fbi conspirator alma peralta described how the perpetrators decided on the federal parking garage as the location shanti bhadra catherine jane stork said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off
the conspirators practiced different ways of murdering turner according to informant statements to law enforcement one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble and the others would then approach turner with their guns informants later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of rajneesh communes if the plan was successful according to the oregonian the assassinations were not carried out because ma anand sheela became distracted by political power plays within the rajneesh commune and other members of the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group

investigation

die another day became a controversial subject in eastern asia the north korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war hungry the south koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 december 2002 as they were offended by the scene in which an american officer issues orders to the south korean army in the defence of their homeland and by a lovemaking scene near a statue of the buddha the jogye buddhist order issued a statement that the film was disrespectful to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics the washington post reported growing resentment in the nation towards the united states an official of the south korean ministry of culture and tourism said that die another day was the wrong film at the wrong time
the amount of product placement in the film was a point of criticism specifically from various news outlets such as the bbc time and reuters who all used the pun buy another day reportedly 20 companies paying 70 million had their products featured in the film a record at the time although usa today reported that number to be as high as 100 million by choice the number of companies involved in product placement was dropped to eight for the next bond film casino royale in 2006
rotten tomatoes listed die another day with a 58 rating metacritic gave the film a 56 out of 100 rating representing mixed or average reviews michael dequina of film threat praised the film as the best of the series to star pierce brosnan and the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory larry carroll of countingdown com praised lee tamahori for having magnificently balanced the film so that it keeps true to the bond legend makes reference to the classic films that preceded it but also injects a new zest to it all entertainment weekly magazine also gave a positive reaction saying that tamahori a true filmmaker has re established the series pop sensuality dana stevens of the new york times called the film the best of the james bond series since the spy who loved me kyle bell of movie freaks 365 stated in his review that the first half of die another day is classic bond but that things start to go downhill when the ice palace gets introduced
however die another day was strongly criticised by some reviewers who felt that the film relied too heavily on gadgets and special effects with the plot being neglected james berardinelli of reelviews net said this is a train wreck of an action film a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs of the action sequences he said die another day is an exercise in loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects the cgi work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything i have seen in a major motion picture coupled with lousy production design die another day looks like it was done on the cheap gary brown of the houston community newspapers also described the weak point of the film as the seemingly non stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the bond character is almost relegated to second string roger moore remarked i thought it just went too far and that s from me the first bond in space invisible cars and dodgy cgi footage please
novelisation
die another day was written into a novel by the then current official james bond writer raymond benson based on the screenplay by neal purvis and robert wade fan reaction to it was above average after its publication benson retired as the official james bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent s adventures as a teenager by charlie higson was launched in 2005 as the novelisation was published after benson s final original 007 novel the man with the red tattoo it was the final literary work featuring bond as originally conceived by ian fleming until the publication of devil may care by sebastian faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of fleming s birth

ayola signed a three year contract to play kyla and described herself as very similar to her character speaking positively about her working relationship with co stars jaye jacobs and sharon d clarke as well as the dream storylines her character was given she said of the show
i really love holby and i m surprised how much what thrills me about holby is that you get back what you put in the powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job for me it s about more than turning up and saying the lines it s about understanding it and trying to make it better that s actually a lot of fun what s great is nobody says just shut up they want you to work at it i surprise myself sometimes because after two and a half years sometimes i see friends on the side of a poster and i think do i want to do something else but i really like this job i never get that awful dread feeling when you really don t want to go into work
in october 2008 ayola announced that she would be departing from holby city in order to have a second child stating i ve had a great time and i ll miss it i made the decision purely because i was pregnant but i wasn t really ready to put down the character of kyla i m very sorry to have to let her go
race and charity work
throughout her career ayola has been outspoken on the subject of racial discrimination in the entertainment industry describing her motivation she states i am not an overtly political person i just want fairness ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts explaining if you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors they are not being sold as a reason to watch she believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin stating i could not have played any of the roles i have played on tv if i was white i am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it s still very low and expectations are still very low she has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and welsh to be a particular problem explaining that i get offered a lot of very different roles but they re never welsh the one time i was asked to play a welsh character on screen was in tiger bay for bbc wales but i know if that series had been called radyr park or cyncoed close i wouldn t have been in it in 2001 ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled persephone s playground she presented the film at the cannes film festival using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre films and television the project however was largely unsuccessful with ayola stating it just made me decide that if there s anything i don t want to do it s produce films because i m rubbish at it i was so bad with the budget that i just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end in 2008 ayola offered her support to the action for southern africa campaign dignity period aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to zimbabwean women
