never think of it my dear fellow any more than if i d never touched a brush
and his tone told me in a flash that he never thought of anything else
i moved away instinctively embarrassed by my unexpected discovery and as i turned my eye fell on a small picture above the mantel piece the only object breaking the plain oak panelling of the room
oh by jove i said
it was a sketch of a donkey an old tired donkey standing in the rain under a wall
by jove a stroud i cried
he was silent but i felt him close behind me breathing a little quickly
what a wonder made with a dozen lines but on everlasting foundations you lucky chap where did you get it
he answered slowly mrs stroud gave it to me
ah i didn t know you even knew the strouds he was such an inflexible hermit
i didn t till after she sent for me to paint him when he was dead
when he was dead you
i must have let a little too much amazement escape through my surprise for he answered with a deprecating laugh yes she s an awful simpleton you know mrs stroud her only idea was to have him done by a fashionable painter ah poor stroud she thought it the surest way of proclaiming his greatness of forcing it on a purblind public and at the moment i was the fashionable painter
ah poor stroud as you say was that his history
that was his history she believed in him gloried in him or thought she did but she couldn t bear not to have all the drawing rooms with her she couldn t bear the fact that on varnishing days one could always get near enough to see his pictures poor woman she s just a fragment groping for other fragments stroud is the only whole i ever knew
you ever knew but you just said
gisburn had a curious smile in his eyes
oh i knew him and he knew me only it happened after he was dead
i dropped my voice instinctively when she sent for you
yes quite insensible to the irony she wanted him vindicated and by me
