i like to fancy that stroud himself would have given it to me if he d been able to say what he thought that day
and in answer to a question i put half mechanically begin again he flashed out when the one thing that brings me anywhere near him is that i knew enough to leave off
he stood up and laid his hand on my shoulder with a laugh only the irony of it is that i am still painting since grindle s doing it for me the strouds stand alone and happen once but there s no exterminating our kind of art
