he laughed again and threw back his head to look up at the sketch of the donkey there were days when i couldn t look at that thing couldn t face it but i forced myself to put it here and now it s cured me cured me that s the reason why i don t dabble any more my dear rickham or rather stroud himself is the reason
for the first time my idle curiosity about my companion turned into a serious desire to understand him better
i wish you d tell me how it happened i said
he stood looking up at the sketch and twirling between his fingers a cigarette he had forgotten to light suddenly he turned toward me
i d rather like to tell you because i ve always suspected you of loathing my work
i made a deprecating gesture which he negatived with a good humoured shrug
oh i didn t care a straw when i believed in myself and now it s an added tie between us
he laughed slightly without bitterness and pushed one of the deep arm chairs forward there make yourself comfortable and here are the cigars you like
he placed them at my elbow and continued to wander up and down the room stopping now and then beneath the picture
how it happened i can tell you in five minutes and it didn t take much longer to happen i can remember now how surprised and pleased i was when i got mrs stroud s note of course deep down i had always felt there was no one like him only i had gone with the stream echoed the usual platitudes about him till i half got to think he was a failure one of the kind that are left behind by jove and he was left behind because he had come to stay the rest of us had to let ourselves be swept along or go under but he was high above the current on everlasting foundations as you say
well i went off to the house in my most egregious mood rather moved lord forgive me at the pathos of poor stroud s career of failure being crowned by the glory of my painting him of course i meant to do the picture for nothing i told mrs stroud so when she began to stammer something about her poverty i remember getting off a prodigious phrase about the honour being mine oh i was princely my dear rickham i was posing to myself like one of my own sitters
then i was taken up and left alone with him i had sent all my traps in advance and i had only to set up the easel and get to work he had been dead only twenty four hours and he died suddenly of heart disease so that there had been no preliminary work of destruction his face was clear and untouched i had met him once or twice years before and thought him insignificant and dingy now i saw that he was superb
i was glad at first with a merely aesthetic satisfaction glad to have my hand on such a subject then his strange life likeness began to affect me queerly as i blocked the head in i felt as if he were watching me do it the sensation was followed by the thought if he were watching me what would he say to my way of working my strokes began to go a little wild i felt nervous and uncertain
once when i looked up i seemed to see a smile behind his close grayish beard as if he had the secret and were amusing himself by holding it back from me that exasperated me still more the secret why i had a secret worth twenty of his i dashed at the canvas furiously and tried some of my bravura tricks but they failed me they crumbled i saw that he wasn t watching the showy bits i couldn t distract his attention he just kept his eyes on the hard passages between those were the ones i had always shirked or covered up with some lying paint and how he saw through my lies
i looked up again and caught sight of that sketch of the donkey hanging on the wall near his bed his wife told me afterward it was the last thing he had done just a note taken with a shaking hand when he was down in devonshire recovering from a previous heart attack just a note but it tells his whole history there are years of patient scornful persistence in every line a man who had swum with the current could never have learned that mighty up stream stroke
i turned back to my work and went on groping and muddling then i looked at the donkey again i saw that when stroud laid in the first stroke he knew just what the end would be he had possessed his subject absorbed it recreated it when had i done that with any of my things they hadn t been born of me i had just adopted them
hang it rickham with that face watching me i couldn t do another stroke the plain truth was i didn t know where to put it i had never known only with my sitters and my public a showy splash of colour covered up the fact i just threw paint into their faces well paint was the one medium those dead eyes could see through see straight to the tottering foundations underneath don t you know how in talking a foreign language even fluently one says half the time not what one wants to but what one can well that was the way i painted and as he lay there and watched me the thing they called my technique collapsed like a house of cards he didn t sneer you understand poor stroud he just lay there quietly watching and on his lips through the gray beard i seemed to hear the question are you sure you know where you re coming out
if i could have painted that face with that question on it i should have done a great thing the next greatest thing was to see that i couldn t and that grace was given me but oh at that minute rickham was there anything on earth i wouldn t have given to have stroud alive before me and to hear him say it s not too late i ll show you how
it was too late it would have been even if he d been alive i packed up my traps and went down and told mrs stroud of course i didn t tell her that it would have been greek to her i simply said i couldn t paint him that i was too moved she rather liked the idea she s so romantic it was that that made her give me the donkey but she was terribly upset at not getting the portrait she did so want him done by some one showy at first i was afraid she wouldn t let me off and at my wits end i suggested grindle yes it was i who started grindle i told mrs stroud he was the coming man and she told somebody else and so it got to be true and he painted stroud without wincing and she hung the picture among her husband s things
he flung himself down in the arm chair near mine laid back his head and clasping his arms beneath it looked up at the picture above the chimney piece
