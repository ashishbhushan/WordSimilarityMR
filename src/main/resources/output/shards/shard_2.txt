bishop eusebius of caesarea c 275 339 was the first to write explicitly that paul was beheaded in rome during the reign of nero he states that nero s persecution led to peter and paul s deaths but that nero did not give any specific orders however several other accounts going back to the 1st century have paul surviving his two years in rome and travelling to hispania before facing trial in rome again prior to his death
peter is first said to have been crucified upside down in rome during nero s reign but not by nero in the apocryphal acts of peter c 200 the account ends with paul still alive and nero abiding by god s command not to persecute any more christians
by the 4th century a number of writers were stating that nero killed peter and paul
the antichrist
the sibylline oracles book 5 and 8 written in the 2nd century speak of nero returning and bringing destruction within christian communities these writings along with others fueled the belief that nero would return as the antichrist in 310 lactantius wrote that nero suddenly disappeared and even the burial place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen this has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that having been conveyed to a distant region he is still reserved alive and to him they apply the sibylline verses lactantius maintains that it is not right to believe this
in 422 augustine of hippo wrote about 2 thessalonians 2 1 11 where he believed paul mentioned the coming of the antichrist though he rejects the theory augustine mentions that many christians believed that nero was the antichrist or would return as the antichrist he wrote so that in saying for the mystery of iniquity doth already work he alluded to nero whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of antichrist
some modern biblical scholars such as delbert hillers johns hopkins university of the american schools of oriental research and the editors of the oxford harper collins study bibles contend that the number 666 in the book of revelation is a code for nero a view that is also supported in roman catholic biblical commentaries
the concept of nero as the antichrist is often a central belief of preterist eschatology

the kingdom of tondo flourished during the latter half of the ming dynasty as a result of direct trade relations with china tondo district was maintained as the traditional capital of the empire with its rulers as sovereign kings and not mere chieftains and were addressed variously as panginuan ln meranau or pangino n in tagalog lords an k banwa son of heaven or lakandula lord of the palace the emperor of china considered the lakans rulers of ancient manila kings
in the 13th century manila consisted of a fortified settlement and trading quarter at the shores of the pasig river on top of previous older towns manila was then settled by the indianized empire of majapahit as referenced in the epic eulogy poem nagarakretagama which inscribed its conquest by maharaja hayam wuruk selurong which is a historical name for the city of manila is listed in canto 14 alongside sulot which is now sulu and kalka

the rizal complex had hosted several multi sport events such as the 1954 asian games and the 1934 far eastern games whenever the country hosts the southeast asian games most of the events are held at the complex but in the 2005 games most events were held elsewhere the 1960 abc championship and the 1973 abc championship forerunners of the fiba asia championship was hosted by the complex with the national basketball team winning on both tournaments the 1978 fiba world championship was held at the complex although the latter stages were held in the araneta coliseum in quezon city southeast asia s largest indoor arena at that time
manila also hosts several well known sports facilities such as the enrique m razon sports center and the university of santo tomas sports complex both of which are private venues owned by a university collegiate sports are also held with the university athletic association of the philippines and the national collegiate athletic association basketball games held at rizal memorial coliseum and ninoy aquino stadium although basketball events had transferred to san juan s filoil flying v arena and the araneta coliseum in quezon city other collegiate sports are still held at the rizal memorial sports complex professional basketball also used to play at the city but the philippine basketball association now holds their games at araneta coliseum and cuneta astrodome at pasay the now defunct philippine basketball league played some of their games at the rizal memorial sports complex
the manila storm are the city s rugby league team training at rizal park luneta park and playing their matches at southern plains field calamba laguna
previously a widely played sport in the city manila is now the home of the only sizable baseball stadium in the country at the rizal memorial baseball stadium the stadium hosts games of baseball philippines lou gehrig and babe ruth were the first players to score a home run at the stadium at their tour of the country on december 2 1934
another popular sport in the city are cue sports and billiard halls are a feature in most barangays the 2010 world cup of pool was held at robinsons place manila
the rizal memorial track and football stadium hosted the first fifa world cup qualifier in decades when the philippines hosted sri lanka in july 2011 the stadium which was previously unfit for international matches had undergone a major renovation program prior to the match the football stadium now regularly hosts matches of the united football league the stadium also hosted its first rugby test when it hosted the 2012 asian five nations division i tournaments

manila has the most number of barangays of any city or municipality in the philippines attempts at reducing its number have not prospered despite local legislation ordinance 7907 passed on 23 april 1996 reducing the number from 897 to 150 by merging existing barangays because of the failure to hold a plebiscite
national government
manila being the seat of political power of the philippines has several national government offices headquartered at the city planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of american colonization to the country when they envisioned a well designed city outside the walls of intramuros the strategic location chosen was bagumbayan a former town which is now the rizal park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to daniel burnham to create a master plan for the city patterned after washington d c these improvements were eventually abandoned under the commonwealth government of manuel l quezon
a new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of manila or what is now quezon city several government agencies have set up their headquarters in quezon city but several key government offices still reside in manila however many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of manila during world war ii and by subsequent administrations
the city as the capital still hosts the office of the president as well as the president s official residence aside from these important institutions such as the supreme court the court of appeals the bangko sentral ng pilipinas the departments of budget and management finance health justice labor and employment and public works and highways still call the city home manila also hosts important national institutions such as the national library national archives national museum and the philippine general hospital
congress previously held office at the old congress building in 1972 due to declaration of martial law congress was dissolved its successor the unicameral batasang pambansa held office at the new batasang pambansa complex when a new constitution restored the bicameral congress the house of representatives stayed at the batasang pambansa complex while the senate remained at the old congress building in may 1997 the senate transferred to a new building it shares with the government service insurance system at reclaimed land at pasay

attalea palm
attalea is a large genus of palms native to mexico the caribbean central and south america this pinnately leaved non spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees the genus has a complicated taxonomic history and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus this has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny
somewhere between 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus with estimates of as many as 100 incomplete herbarium collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species or groups of similar species attalea species have a long history of human use and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats their seeds are animal dispersed including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now extinct pleistocene megafauna
description
the genus attalea has pinnately compound leaves rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather like or fern like pattern species are also non spiny palms and includes both large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres 98 ft tall and acaulescent palms one which lack an aboveground stem the number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty five larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves
inflorescences are large branched and borne among the leaves the inflorescence consists of a main axis the peduncle and the rachis and a series of smaller branches the rachillae the rachillae which bear the flowers emerge from the rachis the peduncle is the main stalk connecting the rachis with the stem inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers or are predominantly female with a few male flowers fruit usually have two or three seeds although fewer or more are present in some species and are usually brown yellow orange brown or purple when mature
four different types of male flowers exist on the basis of these flower types the genus has often been split into four genera a more narrowly defined attalea orbignya maximiliana and scheelea the species sometimes referred to orbignya have coiled anthers while the other groups have straight ones the petals of those placed in maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens while those placed in scheelea and a more narrowly defined attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens five species do not fit easily into any of these groups this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus
taxonomy
attalea has been placed in the subfamily arecoideae the tribe cocoseae and the subtribe attaleinae together with the genera allagoptera beccariophoenix butia cocos jubaea jubaeopsis lytocaryum parajubaea syagrus and voanioala within this subtribe attalea has been found to be a monophyletic group and sister to the clade containing allagoptera polyandrococos parajubaea butia and jubaea
disagreement exists as to whether attalea should be considered a single genus or a group of related genera in their 1996 field guide to the palms of the americas andrew henderson gloria galeano and rodrigo bernal combined all the species in the subtribe attaleinae as it was then defined into a single genus attalea in his 1999 taxonomic treatment of palm subtribe attaleinae american botanist sidney f glassman divided the group into five genera a more narrowly defined attalea orbignya maximiliana scheelea and ynesa raf el govaerts and john dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 world checklist of palms and jean christophe pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus
the multi genus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another four of the genera attalea in a narrow sense orbignya maximiliana and scheelea correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus however a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types including a colenda which glassman placed in its own genus ynesa and this has been used as an argument for the single genus approach in addition there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under glassman s five genus system which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus in 2009 alan meerow and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the subtribe which found that some species placed in orbignya were actually more closely related to species placed in scheelea than they were to other members of that genus if the five genus approach was used while a crassispatha placed in orbignya by glassman was actually a sister to both scheelea and orbignya
history
the genus attalea was first described carl sigismund kunth in 1816 based on specimens collected by alexander von humboldt and aim bonpland although older pre linnaean descriptions exist including charles plumier s 1703 description of a crassispatha the genus was named for attalus iii philometor king of pergamon known for his interest in medicinal plants the type species is a amygdalina a colombian endemic the genera maximiliana and orbignya were described by carl friedrich philipp von martius in 1826 and 1837 respectively scheelea was described by hermann karsten in 1857 and ynesa by orator f cook in 1942
species
experts disagree about the number of species in the genus attalea broadly defined in 1965 dutch taxonomist jan gerard wessels boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus in their 1996 field guide to the palms of the americas andrew henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus while sidney glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group largely following glassman s lead rafa l govaerts and john dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 world checklist of palms an important element of this disagreement is the decision by glassman to define species more narrowly than henderson as a result what henderson interpreted as variation within species glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species this problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections the large size of the leaves inflorescences and fruit of many attalea species makes them difficult to collect in addition many important collections including type specimen have been lost or destroyed sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species
the three recent treatments henderson and coauthors glassman and govaerts and dransfield recognised a total of 73 species but only 20 species are accepted by all of them the remainder account for either nine species or more than 40 for example what andrew henderson considered a single species attalea attaleoides other authors have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species glassman doubted the validity of a attaleoides as a species and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to a attaleoides a camopiensis a degranvillei a guianensis and a maripensis govaerts and dransfield accepted both glassman s four species and a attaleoides however jean christophe pintaud was of the opinion that a guianensis a maripensis and a attaleoides were all very similar and thought it likely that they all represented the same species
another species complex in attalea includes a speciosa and related species henderson 1995 recognised a speciosa and a spectabilis considering the latter to either be an acaulescent form of a speciosa or a hybrid between it and a microcarpa govaerts and dransfield accepted a spectabilis but glassman considered it a dubious taxon attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by michael balick and coauthors glassman and govaerts and dransfield concurred but henderson considered it part of a speciosa glassman also described a fourth member of this group a brejinhoensis and it is accepted by govaerts and dransfield
reproduction and growth
attalea species are monoecious male and female flowers are separate but are borne by the same plant various species have been described as being insect pollinated including a phalerata while pollination in a colenda and a speciosa has been attributed both to insects and wind
seed germination is remote tubular during germination as the cotyledon expands it pushes the young shoot away from the seed after germination the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the aboveground stem this produces a saxophone shaped belowground portion of the stem the fact that the shoot tips of attalea seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire tolerance
distribution
species range across the neotropics from mexico in the north to bolivia paraguay and southern brazil in the south according to govaerts and coauthors three species are found in mexico four in central america and 62 in south america three species are present in the caribbean two in trinidad and tobago along the southern edge of the region and one in haiti
habitat and ecology
attalea includes both large trees and small acaulescent palms which occupy a number of different ecological niches dense stands of some of the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape while smaller species are found in both in the forest understorey and in savannas
disturbance has been implicated in the formation of vegetation dominated by large attalea species in seasonally dry amazonian forests the density of large adult a maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in trinidad and tobago attalea speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared similarly stands of a funifera in bahia brazil which are cultivated for piassava fibre are managed using fire the seedlings survive cutting and burning and are able to dominate burned forest patches
the fruit are dispersed by animals fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by bruchid beetles certain species of attalea have been mentioned as examples of anachronistic species which are adapted for dispersal by now extinct pleistocene megafauna on marac island roraima in the brazilian amazon attalea maripa fruit were consumed by tapirs collared peccaries deer and primates rodents including agoutis fed upon the fruit and as the fruit availability declined they fed on the seeds other dispersers of attalea fruit include crested caracaras which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of a phalerata in the brazilian pantanal
uses
attalea species have a long history of human utilisation carbonised attalea maripa seeds have been found in archaeological sites in colombia dating back to 9000 bp a variety of species remain important sources of edible oil thatch edible seeds and fibre the leaves of attalea butyracea and a maripa are used extensively for thatching several species are oil palms with a speciosa among the most important economically products extracted from a speciosa were reported to support over 300 000 households in the brazilian state of maranh o in 2005 and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450 000 households throughout the brazil piassava fibres extracted from the leaf bases of a funifera are commercially important and generated about us 20 million in annual income to brazilian farmers in 1996
the heart of ezra greer
the heart of ezra greer is a 1917 american silent drama film produced by the thanhouser company and directed by emile chautard the film focuses on ezra greer a successful middle aged man who searches for his college age daughter mary the wayward mary was romanced and abandoned by jack denbeigh later bearing his child once ezra becomes broke he finds employment as the valet for jack denbeigh after jack s engagement to a cabaret girl mary becomes upset and leaves her child at jack s home contrary to jack s wishes ezra keeps the child and jack ultimately reveals that the child is his own ezra convinces jack to make things right and ezra convinces the cabaret girl to leave jack after a carriage accident in which the baby is injured ezra and jack rush to the hospital and find mary as a nurse crying over the child the film ends with the marriage of jack and mary the film was released by path on october 7 1917 the film was the final release from thanhouser and was deemed to be an average film by most reviewers criticism for the film hinged on far fetched coincidences to drive the plot the film is presumed lost

production
the film was the final production and release of the thanhouser company and it was to be released through path numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing of the thanhouser film corporation with much advance notice by edwin thanhouser q david bowers writes that it was easy to understand thanhouser s decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through path were based on their decision to release or discard the work the new rochelle studio was 2 500 miles from the center of the trade activity and the slump in industry tied to world war i weeks before the film was released variety told of the winding down of the thanhouser with the studio s staff consisting of edwin thanhouser and the bookkeeper jessie b bishop the article concluded with the announcement that lloyd f lonergan the scenario writer of the company had retired from the company as it wound down the thanhouser company was announced to have no liabilities would close with a positive bank balance little is known of the production of this final film but it was directed by emile chautard from a scenario written by lloyd f lonergan the cameraman was jacques bizeul
release and reception
the five reel film was released through the path exchange as a path gold rooster play on october 7 1917 charles e wagner of the exhibitor s trade review found it to be a good film with great direction and photography but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared to be involved in the accident was too real wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness which should prove a strong program for the path program frances agnew of the morning telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer a reviewer for the the new york dramatic mirror found the film s excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable but found warde s performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances the reviewer said that emile chautard had made the improbable story more plausible
like many american films of the time the heart of ezra greer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards the chicago board of censors required the cutting in reel 2 of a letter stating i cannot face my father etc and two closeups of gambling scenes and in reel 5 a change of the intertitle because it means her whole future to because she is his wife
free derry
free derry irish saor dhoire was a self declared autonomous nationalist area of derry northern ireland that existed between 1969 and 1972 its name was taken from a sign painted on a gable wall in the bogside in january 1969 which read you are now entering free derry the area which included the bogside and creggan neighbourhoods was secured by community activists for the first time on 5 january 1969 following an incursion into the bogside by members of the royal ulster constabulary ruc residents built barricades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent the ruc from entering after six days the residents took down the barricades and ruc patrols resumed but tensions remained high over the following months
violence reached a peak on 12 august 1969 culminating in the battle of the bogside a three day pitched battle between residents and the ruc on 14 august units of the british army were deployed at the edge of the bogside and the ruc were withdrawn the derry citizens defence association dcda declared their intention to hold the area against both the ruc and the british army until their demands were met the british army made no attempt to enter the area the situation continued until october 1969 when following publication of the hunt report military police were allowed in
the irish republican army ira began to re arm and recruit after august 1969 in december 1969 it split into the official ira and the provisional ira both were supported by the people of the free derry area meanwhile relations between the british army and the nationalist community which were initially good deteriorated in july 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the ira after two young men were shot and killed by british troops the government introduced internment on 9 august 1971 and in response barricades went up once more in the bogside and creggan this time free derry was a no go area defended by armed members of both the official and provisional ira from within the area they launched attacks on the british army and the provisionals began a bombing campaign in the city centre as before unarmed auxiliaries manned the barricades and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the free derry police
support for the ira increased further after bloody sunday in january 1972 when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the british army s parachute regiment at a march in the bogside a 14th man was wounded and died 4 months later the support began to wane after the killing by the official ira of a local youth who was home on leave from the british army after a provisional ira ceasefire during which it entered talks with the british government broke down the british took the decision to move against the no go areas free derry came to an end on 31 july 1972 when thousands of british troops moved in with armoured cars and bulldozers to occupy the area
background
derry city lies near the border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland it has a majority nationalist population and nationalists won a majority of seats in the 1920 local elections despite this the ulster unionist party controlled the local council londonderry corporation from 1923 onwards the unionists maintained their majority firstly by manipulating the constituency boundaries gerrymandering so that the south ward with a nationalist majority returned eight councillors while the much smaller north ward and waterside ward with unionist majorities returned twelve councillors between them secondly by allowing only ratepayers to vote in local elections rather than one man one vote so that a higher number of nationalists who did not own homes were disenfranchised and thirdly by denying houses to nationalists outside the south ward constituency the result was that there were about 2 000 nationalist families and practically no unionists on the housing waiting list and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition the south ward comprised the bogside brandywell creggan bishop street and foyle road and it was this area that would become free derry
the derry housing action committee dhac was formed in march 1968 by members of the derry branch of the northern ireland labour party and the james connolly republican club including eamonn mccann and eamon melaugh it disrupted a meeting of londonderry corporation in march 1968 and in may blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four in the middle of the lecky road in the bogside and staging a sit down protest at the opening of the second deck of the craigavon bridge after the meeting of londonderry corporation was again disrupted in august eamon melaugh telephoned the northern ireland civil rights association nicra and invited them to hold a march in derry the date chosen was 5 october 1968 an adhoc committee was formed although in reality most of the organizing was done by mccann and melaugh and the route was to take the marchers inside the city walls where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march the minister of home affairs william craig made an order on 3 october prohibiting the march on the grounds that the apprentice boys of derry were intending to hold a march on the same day in the words of martin melaugh of cain this particular tactic provided the excuse needed to ban the march when the marchers attempted to defy the ban on 5 october they were stopped by a royal ulster constabulary ruc cordon the police drew their batons and struck marchers including stormont mp eddie mcateer and westminster mp gerry fitt subsequently the police broke ranks and used their batons indiscriminately on people in duke street marchers trying to escape met another party of police and these police also used their batons indiscriminately water cannons were also used the police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of derry and at a meeting four days later the derry citizens action committee dcac was formed with john hume as chairman and ivan cooper as vice chairman
the first barricades
another group formed as a result of the events of 5 october was people s democracy a group of students in queen s university belfast they organised a march from belfast to derry in support of civil rights starting out with about forty young people on 1 january 1969 the march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter demonstrators at several points along the route finally at burntollet bridge five miles outside derry they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs some of them studded with nails and stones half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the b specials the police who were at the scene chatted to the b specials as they prepared their ambush and then failed to protect the marchers many of whom ran into the river and were pelted with stones from the bank dozens of marchers were taken to hospital the remainder continued on to derry where they were attacked once more on their way to craigavon bridge before they finally reached guildhall square where they held a rally rioting broke out after the rally police drove rioters into the bogside but did not come after them in the early hours of the following morning 5 january members of the ruc charged into st columb s wells and lecky road in the bogside breaking windows and beating residents in his report on the disturbances lord cameron remarked that for such conduct among members of a disciplined and well led force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse and added that its effect in rousing passions and inspiring hostility towards the police was regrettably great
that afternoon over 1 500 bogside residents built barricades armed themselves with steel bars wooden clubs and hurleys and told the police that they would not be allowed into the area dcac chairman john hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no one was to come in groups of men wearing armbands patrolled the streets in shifts john caker casey a local activist painted you are now entering free derry in white paint on the gable wall of a house on the corner of lecky road and fahan street that corner which was a popular venue for meetings later became known as free derry corner on 7 january the barricaded area was extended to include the creggan another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the bogside a clandestine radio station calling itself radio free derry began broadcasting to residents playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance on a small number of occasions law breakers attempted crimes but were dealt with by the patrols despite all this the irish times reported that the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week members of the dcac including ivan cooper addressed residents on friday 10 january and called on them to dismantle the barricades the barricades were taken down the following morning
april 1969
over the next three months there were violent clashes with local youths throwing stones at police violence came to a head on saturday 19 april after a planned march from burntollet bridge to the city centre was banned a protest in the city centre led to clashes with paisleyites unionists in sympathy with the anti civil rights stance of ian paisley police attempting to drive the protesters back into the bogside were themselves driven back to their barracks a series of pitched battles followed and barricades were built often under the supervision of bernadette devlin newly elected mp for mid ulster police pursuing rioters broke into a house in william street and severely beat the occupant samuel devenny his family and two friends devenny was brought to hospital bleeding profusely from a number of head wounds at midnight four hundred ruc men in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the bogside convoys of police vehicles drove through the area with headlights blazing
the following day several thousand residents led by the dcac withdrew to the creggan and issued an ultimatum to the ruc withdraw within two hours or be driven out with fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining the police marched out through the butcher s gate even as the residents were entering from the far side the barricades were not maintained on this occasion and routine patrols were not prevented
samuel devenny suffered a heart attack four days after his beating on 17 july he suffered a further heart attack and died thousands attended his funeral and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annual apprentice boys parade scheduled for 12 august could not take place without causing serious disturbance
august october 1969
the apprentice boys parade is an annual celebration by unionists of the relief of the siege of derry in 1689 which began when thirteen young apprentice boys shut the city s gates against the army of king james at that time the parade was held on 12 august each year participants from across northern ireland and britain marched along the city walls above the bogside and were often openly hostile to the residents on 30 july 1969 the derry citizens defence association dcda was formed to try to preserve peace during the period of the parade and to defend the bogside and creggan in the event of an attack the chairman was se n keenan an irish republican army ira veteran the vice chairman was paddy doherty a popular local man sometimes known as paddy bogside and the secretary was johnnie white another leading republican and leader of the james connolly republican club street committees were formed under the overall command of the dcda and barricades were built on the night of 11 august the parade took place as planned on 12 august as it passed through waterloo place on the edge of the bogside hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade fighting between the two groups continued for two hours then the police joined in they charged up william street against the bogsiders followed by the paisleyites they were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs the ensuing battle became known as the battle of the bogside late in the evening having been driven back repeatedly the police fired canisters of cs gas into the crowd youths on the roof of a high rise block of flats on rossville street threw petrol bombs down on the police walkie talkies were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and dcda headquarters in paddy doherty s house in westland street and first aid stations were operating staffed by doctors nurses and volunteers women and girls made milk bottle crates of petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front line and radio free derry broadcast to the fighters and their families on the third day of fighting 14 august the northern ireland government mobilised the ulster special constabulary b specials a force greatly feared by nationalists in derry and elsewhere before they engaged however british troops were deployed at the scene carrying automatic rifles and sub machine guns the ruc and b specials withdrew and the troops took up positions outside the barricaded area
a deputation that included eamonn mccann met senior army officers and told them that the army would not be allowed in until certain demands were met including the disarming of the ruc the disbandment of the b specials and the abolition of stormont the parliament and government of northern ireland the officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the bogside and creggan districts a peace corps was formed to maintain law and order when the british home secretary jim callaghan visited northern ireland and announced his intention to visit the bogside on 28 august he was told that he would not be allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him callaghan agreed accompanied by members of the defence committee he was swept along by a surging crowd of thousands up rossvile street and into lecky road where he took refuge in a local house and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window in preparation for callaghan s visit the free derry wall was painted white and the you are now entering free derry sign was professionally re painted in black lettering
following callaghan s visit some barricades were breached but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform still the army made no move to enter the area law and order was maintained by a peace corps volunteers organised by the dcda to patrol the streets and man the barricades there was very little crime punishment in the words of eamonn mccann as often as not consisted of a stern lecture from se n keenan on the need for solidarity within the area in september the barricades were replaced with a white line painted on the road
the hunt report on the future of policing in northern ireland was presented to the stormont cabinet in early october jim callaghan held talks with the cabinet in belfast on 10 october following which the report s recommendations were accepted and made public they included the recommendation that the ruc should be ordinarily unarmed and that the b specials should be phased out and replaced by a new force the new ruc chief constable arthur young an englishman was announced and travelled to belfast with callaghan the same day se n keenan announced that the dcda was to be dissolved on 11 october callaghan and young visited free derry and on 12 october the first military police entered the bogside on foot and unarmed
ira resurgence
the irish republican army ira had been inactive militarily since the end of the border campaign in 1962 it was low in both personnel and equipment chief of staff cathal goulding told se n keenan and paddy doherty in august 1969 that he couldn t defend the bogside i haven t the men nor the guns to do it during the 1960s the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left its focus was on class struggle and its aim was to unite the irish nationalist and unionist working classes in order to overthrow capitalism both british and irish republican clubs were formed in northern ireland where sinn f in was proscribed these clubs were involved in the formation of nicra in 1967 in derry the james connolly republican club worked closely with labour party radicals with whom they set up the derry housing action committee and derry unemployed action committee the derry citizens defence association was formed initially by republicans who then invited other nationalists to join although there were tensions between the younger leaders like johnnie white and the older traditional republicans such as se n keenan both sides saw the unrest of 1968 69 as a chance to advance republican aims and the two shared the platform at the easter rising commemoration in april 1969
the events of august 1969 in derry and more particularly in belfast where the ira was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the traditionalists and led to a split in december 1969 into the official ira and the provisional ira initially both armies organised for defensive purposes only although the provisionals were planning towards an offensive campaign in derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and householders commonly paid subscriptions to both when rioters were arrested after the official s easter parade in march 1970 officials and provisionals picketed their trial together at the start the officials attracted most of the younger members martin mcguinness who in august 1969 had helped defend the barricades initially joined the officials but a few months later left to join the provisionals
relations between the british army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in august 1969 in september after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds that led to the death of a protestant man william king the british army erected a peace ring to enclose the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary there was anger among young people clashes between youths and troops became more frequent the riot following the officials easter parade in march 1970 marked the first time that the army used snatch squads who rushed into the bogside wielding batons to make arrests the snatch squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations there was also a belief that they were arresting people at random sometimes days after the alleged offence and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance the rioters were condemned as hooligans by moderates who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation the labour radicals and official republicans still working together tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations one such organization was named the young hooligans association but to no avail the provisionals while disapproving of riots viewed them as the inevitable consequence of british occupation this philosophy was more attractive to rioters and some of them joined the provisional ira the deaths of two leading provisionals in a premature explosion in june 1970 resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organization nevertheless up to july 1971 the provisional ira remained numerically small
two men s amas cusack and desmond beattie were shot dead in separate incidents in the early morning and afternoon of 8 july 1971 they were the first people to be killed by the british army in derry in both cases the british army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs while eyewitnesses insisted that both were unarmed the social democratic and labour party sdlp the newly formed party of which john hume and ivan cooper were leading members withdrew from stormont in protest but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed the result was a surge of support for the ira the provisionals held a meeting the following sunday at which they called on people to join the ira following the meeting people queued up to join and there was large scale rioting the british army post at bligh s lane came under sustained attack and troops there and around the city came under fire from the ira
internment and the third free derry
the increasing violence in derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that internment without trial would be introduced in northern ireland and on 9 august 1971 hundreds of republicans and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids in derry residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere nevertheless leading figures including se n keenan and johnnie white were interned in response barricades were erected once again and the third free derry came into existence unlike its predecessors this free derry was marked by a strong ira presence both official and provisional it was defended by armed paramilitaries a no go area one in which british security forces were unable to operate
gun attacks on the british army increased six soldiers were wounded in the first day after internment and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed the first to be killed by either ira in derry the army moved in in force on 18 august to dismantle the barricades a gun battle ensued in which a young provisional ira officer eamonn lafferty was killed a crowd staging a sit down protest was hosed down and the protesters including john hume and ivan cooper arrested with barricades re appearing as quickly as they were removed the army eventually abandoned their attempt
the derry provisionals had little contact with the ira elsewhere they had few weapons about twenty which they used mainly for sniping at the same time they launched their bombing campaign in derry unlike in belfast they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people eamonn mccann wrote that the derry provos under martin mcguinness had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties
although both iras operated openly neither was in control of free derry the barricades were manned by unarmed auxiliaries crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the free derry police which was headed by tony o doherty a derry footballer and northern ireland international
bloody sunday
an anti internment protest organised by the northern ireland civil rights association nicra at magilligan camp in january 1972 was met with violence from the 1st battalion the parachute regiment 1 para nicra had organised a march from the creggan to derry city centre in defiance of a ban on the following sunday 30 january 1972 both iras were asked and agreed to suspend operations on that day to ensure the march passed off peacefully the british army erected barricades around the free derry area to prevent marchers from reaching the city centre on the day march organisers turned the march away from the barriers and up to free derry corner but some youths proceeded to the barrier at william street and stoned soldiers troops from 1 para then moved into free derry and opened fire killing thirteen people all of whom were subsequently found to be unarmed a fourteenth shooting victim died four months later in june 1972 like the killing of cusack and beattie the previous year bloody sunday had the effect of hugely increasing recruitment to the ira even among people who previously would have been moderates
february july 1972
both the provisional and official ira stepped up attacks after bloody sunday with the tacit support of the residents local feelings changed however with the killing of ranger william best by the official ira best was a 19 year old local man who was home on leave from the british army at his parents house in the creggan he was abducted interrogated and shot the following day 500 women marched to the republican club offices in protest nine days later on 29 may the official ira declared a ceasefire the provisional ira initially stated that they would not follow suit but after informal approaches to the british government they announced a ceasefire from 26 june martin mcguinness was the derry representative in a party of senior provisionals who travelled to london for talks with william whitelaw the secretary of state for northern ireland the talks were not resumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in belfast when troops prevented catholic families from taking over houses in the lenadoon estate
political pressure for the action against the no go areas increased after the events of bloody friday in belfast a british army attack was considered inevitable and the ira took the decision not to resist it on 31 july 1972 operation motorman was launched when thousands of british troops equipped with armoured cars and armoured bulldozers avres dismantled the barricades and occupied the area
subsequent history
after operation motorman the british army controlled the bogside and creggan by stationing large numbers of troops within the area by conducting large scale search operations that were in fact undertaken for purposes of intelligence gathering and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts over the following years ira violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe the war was over in the area although there were still frequent street riots nationalists even those who did not support the ira remained bitterly opposed to the army and to the state
many of the residents original grievances were addressed with the passing of the local government northern ireland act 1972 which redrew the electoral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the single transferable vote elections were held in may 1973 nationalists gained a majority on the council for the first time since 1923 since then the area has been extensively redeveloped with modern housing replacing the old houses and flats the free derry era is commemorated by the free derry wall the murals of the bogside artists and the museum of free derry

background

parodies
view of the world has been imitated without authorization in a variety of ways the work has been imitated in postcard format by numerous municipalities states and nations steinberg had stated that he could have retired on royalties from the many parodies made of the painting had they been paid a motivation for his eventual copyright lawsuit for the moscow on the hudson use fulford writing in the national post noted that the metaphor of the world as a suburb of manhattan was understood and borrowed by the whole world local artists especially poster artists presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions fulford demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban ottawa made imitating view of the world an assignment in its graphic arts class he also noted that the results of this assignment was a worldwide variety of global foci from which the students viewed the world
the illustration humorously depicting new yorkers self image of their place in the world or perhaps outsiders view of new yorkers self image inspired many similar works including the poster for the 1984 film moscow on the hudson that movie poster led to a lawsuit steinberg v columbia pictures industries inc 663 f supp 706 s d n y 1987 which held that columbia pictures violated the copyright steinberg held on his work
on june 5 2003 during the first term of george w bush s presidency ted rall presented a view of the world from pennsylvania avenue as a parody of view of the world from 9th avenue in a universal press syndicate editorial cartoon he replaced the letters representing the new yorker with the bushie
the cover was later satirized by barry blitt for the cover of the new yorker on october 6 2008 the cover featured sarah palin looking out of her window seeing only alaska with russia in the far background
the march 21 2009 the economist included a story entitled how china sees the world that presents a parody that is also an homage to the original image but depicting the viewpoint from beijing s chang an avenue instead of manhattan a caption above the illustration reads illustration by jon berkeley with apologies to steinberg and the new yorker it accompanied an article that discussed the burgeoning chinese economy at the time of the contemporary financial crisis
the october 1 2012 cover of mad magazine satirized the problems with the september release of apple inc s ios 6 mobile operating system which included apple maps a replacement for google maps the work presents what view of the world might look like if one had relied upon the september 2012 version of apple maps to locate various landmarks
critical review
on october 17 2005 american society of magazine editors unveiled its list of the top 40 magazine covers of the prior 40 years and ranked view of the world from 9th avenue in fourth place the listing stated that the work has come to represent manhattan s telescoped perception of the country beyond the hudson river the cartoon showed the supposed limited mental geography of manhattanites

the fort of bintulu which was built entirely of wood was in somewhat ruinous condition it stood nearly on the sea shore and just behind it at a distance of few paces the primeval forests commenced some chinamen had settled at the vicinity of the fort and had built a small bazaar but the village is chiefly formed by the houses of the melanau beyond the chinese kampong village these melanaus used to live further up the river but since the construction of the fort and the installation of an officer of the rajah near the mouth of the river they came to settle near the sea a thing they would never have dared to do in former days for fear of the attacks of the lanun pirates and dayak pirates
the houses of the melanau people were built in rows on both sides of the kemena river mostly furnished by nipah and sago palms each house had its own shed projection into the entrance of the river which was used for the processing of sago palms on 8 september 1867 the first sarawak general council meeting now sarawak state legislative assembly took place here it was made up of 21 elected local community members five british officers and 16 malay and melanau local chiefs the council was formed by raja muda charles brooke under orders from rajah james brooke the council is the oldest state legislative assembly in malaysia

temple beth israel eugene oregon
temple beth israel hebrew is a reconstructionist synagogue located at 1175 east 29th avenue in eugene oregon founded in the early 1930s as a conservative congregation beth israel was for many decades the only synagogue in eugene
the congregation initially worshipped in a converted house on west eighth street it constructed its first building on portland street in 1952 and occupied its current leed compliant facilities in 2008
in the early 1990s conflict between feminist and traditional members led to the latter leaving beth israel and forming the orthodox congregation ahavas torah beth israel came under attack from neo nazi members of the volksfront twice in 1994 and again in 2002 in both cases the perpetrators were caught and convicted
services were lay led for decades marcus simmons was hired as the congregation s first rabbi in 1959 but left in 1961 after a gap of two years louis neimand became rabbi in 1963 and served until his death in 1976 he was followed by myron kinberg who served from 1977 to 1994 and kinberg in turn was succeeded by yitzhak husbands hankin maurice harris joined husbands hankin as associate rabbi in 2003 and served until 2011 when he was succeeded by boris dolin as of 2014 led by husbands hankin and dolin beth israel had approximately 400 member households and was the largest synagogue in eugene
early history
small numbers of german jews began settling in eugene in the late 19th century but most moved on in the early 20th century the first eastern european jews settled there and by the 1920s eugene s jewish community began gathering prayer quorums for holding friday night and jewish holiday services in individuals homes historian steven lowenstein writes that a fter hymen rubenstein s death in 1933 his home at 231 west eighth street was remodeled and named temple beth israel it was a traditional conservative synagogue and from that time until the 1990s it was the only synagogue in eugene
in 1952 the congregation constructed a one story synagogue building on an almost 1 acre 0 40 ha property at 2550 portland street designed by architect and holocaust survivor heinrich hormuth h h waechter the building featured an interior courtyard that provided natural lighting and a network of ceiling beams painted with symbols and shapes by waechter
temple beth israel s services and religious functions were lay led for decades its first rabbi was marcus simmons originally from england he was a graduate of university of london and oxford university and was ordained at the hebrew theological seminary he emigrated to the united states in 1957 and joined beth israel in 1959 the members were not however agreed that a full time rabbi was required and in 1961 he accepted a rabbinical position in downey california
following a hiatus of two years louis neimand was hired as rabbi in 1963 born in new york city in 1912 to immigrant parents he was a graduate of city university of new york and was ordained at the jewish institute of new york he had previously worked for the united jewish appeal and from 1959 to 1963 was the first hillel rabbi at syracuse university there was some concern about neimand s hiring as he had a police record as a result of his involvement in freedom marches in the african american civil rights movement 1955 1968 he served until his death in 1976
kinberg era
myron kinberg was hired as rabbi in 1977 ordained in reform judaism he had previously served as a rabbi in topeka kansas for two years then lived in israel for two years before coming to eugene kinberg was known for his support for minority rights and gay rights anti nuclear and anti war activism support of reconciliation between israel and the palestinians and outreach to non observant members of eugene s jewish community
kinberg attempted to revive the biblical concept of the ger toshav in his approach to intermarriage he was willing to officiate at an intermarriage if the non jewish partner after discussions with the rabbi agreed of his or her own free will to fulfill a set of commitments including a commitment to a jewish home life participation in jewish life and tradition and raising future children as jews the non jewish partner making this commitment became a ger toshav or non jewish member of the jewish people
kinberg s wife alice was a strong feminist and during the 1980s he and his wife supported a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual these included allowing women to read from the torah and lead the prayers and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive for example using gender neutral terms and pronouns for god and adding references to the biblical matriarchs in prayers like the amidah which traditionally only mentioned the biblical patriarchs while most congregation members approved of these changes a minority resisted them
schism
by the early 1990s serious divisions developed among the members of the congregation over a number of issues including personal antagonisms the rabbi s activism and advocacy of ultra liberal causes political differences over the israeli palestinian conflict and
a myriad of additional jewish cultural religious issues such as the acceptance of intermarried couples adherence to kosher dietary laws the use of modern language and music during worship services rewriting of certain prayers such as the aleynu to make them less ethnocentric and so on
however the biggest source of division which underlay all others was the roles and rights of men and women in the synagogue
in the early 1990s a group of newly observant members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue complete with a mechitza a partition separating men and women the more feminist minded members strongly objected to having a mechitza anywhere in the temple beth israel building even if it were not in the services they attended the latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the mechitza would have to be taken down or those members who wanted it would have to leave kinberg also signed the petition faced with this opposition in 1992 the orthodox members left renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi creating eugene s second synagogue originally called the halachic minyan and in 1998 renamed congregation ahavas torah
kinberg held himself responsible and the schism led to his reassessment of the needs of temple beth israel and his role as a rabbi as a result he left beth israel in 1994 to lead a synagogue on long island during his tenure at beth israel membership rose from 118 to 350 families kinberg died two years later at age 51
husbands hankin era
yitzhak husbands hankin succeeded kinberg in 1995 husbands hankin began his involvement at temple beth israel first as a congregant then as cantor and then as an assistant rabbi he was active in forming the jewish renewal movement and was ordained by its leader zalman schachter shalomi
the congregation decided to leave the conservative movement in 1995 and for a year had no affiliation in late 1996 after considering both reform and reconstructionist as alternatives the congregation affiliated with the reconstructionist movement by 1999 membership had grown to around 370 families
husbands hankin was instrumental in developing the concept of ethical kashrut the idea that one should only purchase goods that are produced in an ethical way his essay ethical kashrut was selected for publication in arthur kurzweil s best jewish writing 2003 a singer cello and guitar player he composes and performs jewish music
husbands hankin has had four assistant or associate rabbis working with him shoshana spergel joined temple beth israel in 1998 as interim rabbi when husbands hankins went on a sabbatical jonathan seidel was assistant rabbi from 2001 to 2003 maurice harris a 2003 graduate of the reconstructionist rabbinical college joined as assistant rabbi in 2003 he is one of the signators of the open letter concerning religion and science from american rabbis part of the clergy letter project which encourages and embraces the teaching of evolution in schools in 2011 boris dolin joined the congregation as its newest associate rabbi
attacks by neo nazis
on march 20 1994 chris lord an individual associated with the volksfront and american front fired ten rounds with an assault rifle into the temple damaging the interior the attacks were prompted by a newspaper article about several members of eugene s jewish community including a lesbian community organizations including a local gay rights group responded by standing vigil outside the synagogue during passover services lord and an associate were caught and convicted and lord was sentenced to four and a half years in prison
on october 25 2002 jacob laskey his brother gabriel laskey gerald poundstone jesse baker and one other man all members of the volksfront drove to beth israel with the intent of intimidating the congregants while a service with 80 members attending was taking place the men threw rocks etched with nazi swastikas through the synagogue s stained glass windows then sped off the men were caught pleaded guilty and were convicted they served sentences ranging from a 6 month work release term and five years probation to eleven years and three months in federal prison for the ringleader jacob laskey
east 29th avenue building
originally sized for 75 families temple beth israel s portland street building had been renovated and enlarged over the years to 7 500 square feet 700 m2 to accommodate 250 families and 150 students despite these additions and the loss of members to congregation ahavas torah the synagogue was not large enough particularly during the high holidays when extra space had to be rented in 1997 the congregation purchased the property of the university street christian church for 500 000 today 740 000 and began planning for a new facility the members considered renovating the existing building on the property but felt a new building would better suit their requirements and razed the church
in 2003 the congregation got a permit to begin construction of a new facility on the now vacant 1 37 acre 0 55 ha plot of land at the northwest corner of east 29th avenue and university street an initial capital campaign raised more than 1 8 million which fully paid for the land and by august 2007 an additional 1 7 million had been raised towards anticipated overall project costs of 5 million
the environmentally sensitive building was designed by mel solomon and associates of kansas city and local company tbg architects planners and built by mckenzie commercial construction of eugene the building used energy efficient heating ventilation and lighting specific design issues with the building s energy efficiency included the fact that the largest room in the building the sanctuary was also the least used and in accord with jewish tradition had to face east towards jerusalem
on june 8 2008 the congregation dedicated its new building at 1175 east 29th avenue at approximately 25 000 square feet 2 300 m2 the facility included a sanctuary commercial kitchen banquet facilities and classrooms and housed the synagogue the lane county jewish federation and the local jewish family service the project ended up costing 6 million of which 4 million had been raised

ny 3 was realigned c 1932 to follow saunders settlement road between shawnee road ny 425 and upper mountain road the former routing of ny 3 along shawnee lower mountain gothic hill and upper mountain roads was redesignated as ny 3a even though all of ny 3 s former routing was already part of either ny 425 or ny 93 the ny 3a designation was eliminated c 1935 when ny 3 was truncated eastward to a new western terminus in central new york in the early 1940s ny 93 was altered to follow north ridge road u s route 104 now ny 104 and junction road between north ridge and lower mountain road
around the same time that ny 93 was rerouted ny 270 was also extended northward along junction road from ny 31 to us 104 as a result ny 93 overlapped ny 270 between lower mountain road and us 104 the overlap with ny 270 remained in place until c 1963 when ny 270 was truncated southward to the intersection of lower mountain and junction roads ny 93 was realigned in the late 1970s to bypass lower mountain and gothic hill roads on junction and upper mountain roads replacing ny 270 along junction road the lower mountain road portion of ny 93 s former routing is now maintained by niagara county as county route 902 cr 902
lockport realignments
the lockport bypass a highway bypassing downtown lockport to the southwest was opened to traffic on july 26 1991 the highway cost 7 7 million equivalent to 13 4 million in 2016 to construct and extended from the junction of ny 31 and ny 93 west of the city to robinson road south of downtown ny 93 was realigned to follow the new bypass south to robinson road where it turned east and followed robinson road cr 123 and dysinger road cr 133 to akron road in royalton the portion of akron road ny 93 s former routing east of the lockport city limits became ny 954m an unsigned reference route
ownership and maintenance of robinson road from the bypass to ny 78 was transferred from niagara county to the state of new york on september 1 1990 as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government the portion of ny 93 between ny 78 and akron road became state maintained on october 1 1998 as part of another swap that also transferred ownership and maintenance of akron road to niagara county akron road is now cr 142
on november 1 2005 the niagara county legislature voted on a measure to allow the county to ask the new york state department of transportation nysdot to remove the ny 93 designation from upper mountain road a county maintained highway and reassign it to junction road ny 270 and saunders settlement road ny 31 the impetus for the change came from a resident of upper mountain road who demanded that trucks should be removed from the roadway this part of the agenda was passed nysdot obliged to the request in 2006 rerouting ny 93 as proposed and truncating ny 270 southward to ny 31

typhoon krosa 2013
typhoon krosa known in the philippines as typhoon vinta was a typhoon that made landfall in the northern philippines in late october 2013 forming on october 27 near guam the storm slowly intensified while moving westward krosa developed an eye and became a typhoon before striking luzon on october 31 the storm weakened over land but re intensified over the south china sea reaching peak winds of 150 km h 90 mph on november 2 off the southeast coast of china typhoon krosa stalled and encountered unfavorable conditions resulting in quick weakening by november 3 it had weakened to tropical storm status and was no longer being warned on by the next day in northern luzon krosa damaged 32 000 houses including 3 000 that were destroyed and caused four fatalities high winds and rainfall left p277 million php 6 4 million usd in damage
meteorological history
on october 27 an area of convection with a broad circulation persisted southeast of guam and slowly consolidated due to moderate wind shear and westerly outflow that day the japan meteorological agency jma classified the system as a tropical depression about 380 km 235 mi to the southeast of hag t a guam at 2100 utc on october 28 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa began issuing advisories on the depression giving it the local name vinta the next day the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm krosa 1329 and the joint typhoon warning center jtwc also classified it as tropical depression 29w by that time the storm was moving steadily westward due to the subtropical ridge to the north with the warm waters of the philippine sea lessening wind shear and improving outflow krosa gradually strengthened and the jtwc also upgraded krosa to tropical storm status on october 30 after an eye feature developed
while approaching northern luzon on october 29 krosa quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a well defined eye late on october 30 the jtwc upgraded krosa to typhoon status and the next day both pagasa and jma followed suit on october 31 krosa made landfall in northeastern luzon near cagayan and developed a symmetric eyewall while initially moving over land land interaction weakened the eye by the time krosa emerged into the south china sea late on october 31 the next day pagasa discontinued advisories after the typhoon exited the region convection rebuilt around the center with continued favorable conditions allowing for restrengthening
late on november 1 a large eye redeveloped and the jtwc estimated krosa attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 185 km h 115 mph early the next day the jma also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10 minute winds of 140 km h 85 mph later increasing wind shear caused the eye to deteriorate and krosa began slowing about 260 km 160 mi east southeast of hong kong after reaching the western edge of the subtropical ridge after remaining nearly stationary krosa began moving steadily to the west southwest due to a new ridge the convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from upwelling and krosa deteriorated to tropical storm status on november 3 the next day the jtwc issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection also on november 4 the jma downgraded krosa to tropical depression status off the northeast vietnam coast the system dissipated at 0000 utc on november 5
preparations and impact
before krosa struck the philippines pagasa issued a number 3 warning signal for portions of northern luzon where winds were expected to reach over 100 km h 60 mph the agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides high winds knocked down trees across luzon and left about 80 of cagayan province without power as well as some areas without internet or cellphone service portions of the pan philippine highway were blocked and in lal lo cagayan a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages agriculture damage was estimated at p273 million php 6 3 million usd occurring just before the start of the harvest across the island the typhoon damaged 32 745 houses including 3 837 that were destroyed forcing 65 648 people to evacuate to storm shelters overall krosa killed four people in the philippines and left p273 million php 6 4 million usd in damage after the storm workers quickly restored power lines while the government provided monetary assistance to storm ravaged families after cagayan was declared a state of calamity members of the philippine military and department of public works and highways worked to clean up following the storm
the china national meteorological centre issued a yellow alert the second lowest of the four level warning system for hainan due to the threat of the storm the agency recommended boats to return to port agencies in vietnam also warned for the potential of heavy rainfall due to the dissipating tropical depression krosa and released water from three dams to prevent overflow
kirby s block ball
kirby s block ball is a 1995 action video game a spin off from the kirby series for the game boy portable console it is a breakout clone the player controls paddles along the screen s edge to knock a bouncing ball kirby into destructible bricks the game s 55 levels include power ups bonus rounds and minigames kirby s block ball was developed by hal laboratory and nintendo r d1 the team spent half a year revising the gameplay to match kirby s signature characteristics kirby s block ball was published by nintendo first in japan in 1995 later in europe and last in north america in 1996
reviewers considered the game an improvement on the breakout formula and praised its gameplay craftsmanship and incorporation of the kirby series it was included in multiple top game boy game lists and was later emulated on the nintendo 3ds virtual console
gameplay
the player controls paddles along the screen s edges to knock a bouncing ball kirby into destructible bricks the player loses a life if kirby hits the edge of the screen each of the game s eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for kirby to clear the ten different block types vary in durability and points value a well timed hit of the paddle gives kirby a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time the player can find warp stars that lead to minigames such as air hockey where the player can earn extra lives the rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid some enemies contain bonus items each stage ends in a boss fight
with stone needle flame and spark power ups kirby can transform to interact with blocks differently for instance the spark power up lets kirby break through otherwise indestructible blocks and the needle lets kirby hit spikes once without losing a life the game has a themed frame and uses a wide palette of colors in game when played with the super game boy
development
the game was developed by hal laboratory with gunpei yokoi s nintendo r d1 and published by nintendo at one point in development hal decided that the game did not feel like a kirby game the team spent six months completely revising the game under explicit instructions on how kirby should move kirby games contain elements of unrestricted creative movement as a general theme kirby s block ball was released for the game boy first in japan in 1995 and later in europe 1995 and north america may 1996 it was later emulated on the nintendo 3ds virtual console and released first in japan october 2011 and later in europe february 2012 and north america may 2012
reception and legacy
on release the four reviewers of electronic gaming monthly applauded kirby s block ball for modifying the breakout formula to create a new and enjoyable game they especially praised the unique power ups though crispin boyer and sushi x also felt the game was too short and easy nintendo power said they enjoyed block ball and its number of stages but wondered how its eight megabits of memory were being used the magazine found the parts where kirby eats the unbreakable blocks to be innovative all six of the magazine s reviewers recommended the game
ign wrote that the game was primarily remembered as an arkanoid or breakout clone skinned with the kirby franchise ign calculated an average reviewer score of 7 4 10 the kirby series became known for its number of non platformer spin offs of which block ball was one like kirby s pinball land and kirby s dream course kirby s spherical shape lent itself towards ball like roles ign wrote that block ball was the first truly out there kirby spin off but that the game was too short
planet game boy called it one of the original game boy s ten all time classics and gamesradar placed it among the top 25 game boy games released they considered kirby s block ball an improvement upon alleyway a game boy launch title and breakout clone ign recommended the game upon its 3ds rerelease both in general and for breakout fans nintendo world report recommended the game to players who like score attack games and called it the best version of breakout released retrospective reviewers found the game enjoyable and praised the craft behind the gameplay and kirby themes alternatively kirby s block ball received the lowest rating on tim rogers s 2004 yamanote scoring system for portable games a metric by which he played a game while counting stops on the circular yamanote train line until he lost interest with a score of one stop he called it too damned bland
in a retrospective review jeuxvideo com had high praise for the level design graphics and animations they also found the music excellent in comparison to the annoying and repetitive soundtrack of most breakout clones the magazine also liked how the game fit the kirby universe apart from its increased difficulty jeuxvideo com occasionally had trouble hitting the slow paced ball with precision

the commission as part of its mandate is responsible for commemorating all commonwealth war dead individually and equally to this end the war dead are commemorated by name on a headstone at an identified site of a burial or on a memorial war dead are commemorated uniformly and equally irrespective of military or civil rank race or creed

history
world war i
on the outbreak of world war i in 1914 fabian ware a director of the rio tinto company found that at 45 years old he was too old to join the british army he used the influence of rio tinto chairman viscount milner to become the commander of a mobile unit of the british red cross he arrived in france in september 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the red cross for this purpose in march 1915 with the support of nevil macready adjutant general of the british expeditionary force ware s work was given official recognition and support by the imperial war office and the unit was transferred to the british army as the graves registration commission the new graves registration commission had over 31 000 graves of british and imperial soldiers registered by october 1915 and 50 000 registered by may 1916
when municipal graveyards began to overfill ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries ware began with an agreement with france to build joint british and french cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the french government ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the french government and subsequently arranged for france to purchase the land grant it in perpetuity and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the british the french government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions were accessible by public road were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages similar negotiations were started with the belgian government
as reports of the grave registration work became public the commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers by 1917 17 000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives in march 1915 the commission with the support of the red cross began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests the graves registration commission became the directorate of graves registration and enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed the directorate s work was also extended beyond the western front and into other theatres of war with units deployed in greece egypt and mesopotamia
formal establishment
as the war continued ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post war period following a suggestion by the british army the national committee for the care of soldiers graves was appointed by the british government in january 1916 with edward prince of wales agreeing to serve as president the national committee for the care of soldiers graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the directorate of graves registration and enquiries after the war the government felt that it was more appropriate to entrust the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department by early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves with the help of edward prince of wales ware submitted a memorandum to the imperial war conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted the suggestion was accepted and on 21 may 1917 the imperial war graves commission was established by royal charter with the prince of wales serving as president secretary of state for war lord derby as chairman and ware as vice chairman the commission s undertakings began in earnest at the end of the first world war once land for cemeteries and memorials had been guaranteed the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin by 1918 some 587 000 graves had been identified and a further 559 000 casualties were registered as having no known grave
the scale and associated high number of casualties of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead previous to world war i individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers however the war required mobilisation of a significant percentage of the population either as volunteers or through conscription an expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated even if they were low ranking members of the military a committee under frederic kenyon director of the british museum presented a report to the commission in november 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks
an article in the times on 17 february 1919 by rudyard kipling carried the commission s proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like the article entitled war graves work of imperial commission mr kipling s survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet graves of the fallen the illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of kenyon s report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos there was an immediate public outcry following the publication of the reports particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead the reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in parliament on 4 may 1920 sir james remnant started the debate followed by speeches by william burdett coutts in favour of the commission s principles and robert cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers winston churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote remnant withdrew his motion allowing the commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles
first cemeteries and memorials to the missing
three of the most eminent architects of their day sir herbert baker sir reginald blomfield and sir edwin lutyens were commissioned to design the cemeteries and memorials rudyard kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions
in 1920 the commission built three experimental cemeteries at le treport forceville and louvencourt following the principles outlined in the kenyon report of these the forceville communal cemetery and extension was agreed to be the most successful having consulted with garden designer gertrude jekyll the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform headstones in a garden setting augmented by blomfield s cross of sacrifice and lutyens stone of remembrance after some adjustments forceville became the template for the commission s building programme adjustments were required because all three experimental cemeteries went over budget to ensure future cemeteries remained within their budget the commission decided to not build shelters in cemeteries that contained less than 200 graves to not place a stone of remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves and to limit the height of cemetery walls to 1 metre 3 3 ft
at the end of 1919 the commission had spent 7 500 and this figure rose to 250 000 in 1920 as construction of cemeteries and memorials increased by 1921 the commission had established 1 000 cemeteries which were ready for headstone erections and burials between 1920 and 1923 the commission was shipping 4 000 headstones a week to france in many cases small cemeteries were closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones by 1927 when the majority of construction had been completed over 500 cemeteries had been built with 400 000 headstones a thousand crosses of sacrifice and 400 stones of remembrance
the commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave which amounted to 315 000 in france and belgium alone the commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the western front after resistance from the french committee responsible for the approvals of memorials on french territory the commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing cemeteries rather than as separate structures
reginald blomfield s menin gate was the first memorial to the missing located in europe to be completed and was unveiled on 24 july 1927 the menin gate menenpoort was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34 984 names of the missing were instead inscribed on herbert baker s tyne cot memorial to the missing other memorials followed the helles memorial in gallipoli designed by john james burnet the thiepval memorial on the somme and the arras memorial designed by edwin lutyens and the basra memorial in iraq designed by edward prioleau warren the dominions and india also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing the neuve chapelle memorial for the forces of india the vimy memorial by canada the villers bretonneux memorial by australia the delville wood memorial by south africa and the beaumont hamel memorial by newfoundland the programme of commemorating the dead of the great war was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the thiepval memorial in 1932 though the vimy memorial would not be finished until 1936 the villers bretonneux memorial until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the menin gate when germany invaded belgium in 1940
the only memorial created by the commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the opththalmic institute at giza egypt complete with library and bacteriology and pathology departments as its memorial to men of the egyptian labour corps and camel transport corps its erection was agreed with local political pressure
world war ii
from the start of the second world war in 1939 the commission organised grave registration units and planning ahead based on the experience gained from the first world war earmarked land for use as cemeteries when the war began turning in favour of the allies the commission was able to begin restoring its first world war cemeteries and memorials it also began the task of commemorating the 600 000 commonwealth casualties from the second world war in 1949 the commission completed dieppe canadian war cemetery the first of 559 new cemeteries and 36 new memorials eventually over 350 000 new headstones were erected many were made from hopton wood stone the wider scale of world war ii coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer following the war the commission implemented a five year horticultural renovation programme the horticultural neglect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary structural repairs to be made these together with the backlog of maintenance tasks from before the war took a further 10 years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s
with the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the world war i winston churchill agreed to ware s proposal that the commission also maintain a record of commonwealth civilian war deaths a supplemental chapter was added to the imperial war graves commission s charter on 7 february 1941 empowering the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the second world war which resulted in the creation of the civilian war dead roll of honour the roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67 000 civilians the commission and the dean of westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in westminster abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended the commission handed over the first six volumes to the dean of westminster on 21 february 1956 the final volume was added to the showcase in 1958
post world war ii
following world war ii the commission recognised that the word imperial within its name was no longer appropriate in the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organisation s name was changed to commonwealth war graves commission in 1960
more recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether zehrensdorf indian cemetery in germany was unkempt after the end of world war ii and until the german reunification because it was located in an area occupied by russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005 the six day war and war of attrition resulted in the destruction of port tewfik memorial and aden memorial and the death of a commission gardener at suez war memorial cemetery during the lebanese civil war two cemeteries in beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt the maintenance of war graves and memorials in iraq has remained difficult since iran iraq war in the 1980s with regular maintenance being impractical since after the gulf war
the commission has and continues to also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate in 1982 the british ministry of defence requested the commission s assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the falkland islands for those killed during the falklands war although these cemeteries are not commonwealth war graves commission cemeteries the commission manages the administrative responsibilities of these cemeteries since 2005 the commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the british ministry of defence for cemeteries and graves of british and imperial soldiers who died during the second boer war in 2003 veterans affairs canada employed the commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the canadian minister of veterans affairs has responsibility as of 2011 the commission conducts a twelve year cyclical inspection programme of canadian veterans markers installed at the expense of the government of canada
in 2008 an exploratory excavation discovered mass graves on the edge of pheasant wood outside of fromelles two hundred and fifty british and australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed fromelles pheasant wood military cemetery this was the first new commonwealth war graves commission cemetery in more than 50 years the last such cemeteries having been built after the second world war
burial sites and memorials
the commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1 7 million deceased commonwealth military service members in 153 countries and approximately 67 000 civilians who died as a result of enemy action during world war ii commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a headstone at an identified site of a burial or on a memorial as a result the commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23 000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide the vast majority of burial sites are pre existing communal or municipal cemeteries and parish churchyards located in the united kingdom however the commission has itself constructed approximately 2 500 war cemeteries worldwide the commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave the largest of these is the thiepval memorial
qualifications for inclusion
the commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years while in commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service the applicable periods of consideration are 4 august 1914 to 31 august 1921 for the first world war and 3 september 1939 to 31 december 1947 for the second world war the end date for the first world war period is the official end of the war while for the second world war the commission selected a date approximately the same period after ve day as the official end of the first world war was after the 1918 armistice
civilians who died as a result of enemy action during the second world war are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service they are commemorated by name through the civilian war dead roll of honour located in st george s chapel in westminster abbey in addition to its mandated duties the commission maintains under arrangement with applicable governments over 40 000 non commonwealth war graves and over 25 000 non war military and civilian graves
architects and sculptors
as well as the main principal architects for france and belgium baker blomfield and lutyens there were principal architects appointed for other regions as well sir robert lorimer was principal architect for italy macedonia and egypt while sir john james burnet was principal architect for palestine and gallipoli assisted by thomas smith tait the principal architect for mesopotamia was edward prioleau warren
as well as these senior architects there was a team of assistant architects who were actually responsible for many of the cemetery and memorial designs these architects were younger and many of them had served in the war the assistant architects were george esselmont gordon leith wilfred clement von berg charles henry holden who in 1920 became a principal architect william harrison cowlishaw william bryce binnie george hartley goldsmith frank higginson arthur james scott hutton noel ackroyd rew and john reginald truelove other architects that worked for the commission or won competitions for the commission memorials included george salway nicol harold chalton bradshaw verner owen rees gordon h holt and henry philip cart de lafontaine
in january 1944 edward maufe was appointed principal architect for the uk maufe worked extensively for the commission for 25 years until 1969 becoming chief architect and also succeeding kenyon as artistic advisor together with maufe the other principal architects appointed during and after the second world war were hubert worthington louis de soissons philip hepworth and colin st clair oakes
leading sculptors that worked on the memorials and cemeteries after the first world war included eric henri kennington charles thomas wheeler gilbert ledward and charles sargeant jagger other sculptors both in the inter war period and after the second world war included william reid dick ernest gillick basil gotto alfred turner laurence a turner walter gilbert henry poole vernon hill robert anning bell ferdinand victor blundstone joseph armitage and gilbert bayes
cemetery design
common architectural design features
structural design has always played an important part in the commission s cemeteries apart from a few exceptions due to local geological conditions the cemeteries follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world this makes the cemeteries easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries
a typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought iron gate entrance for cemeteries in france and belgium a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the french or belgian governments all but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials a plan of the plots and rows and a basic history of the cemetery the register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery more recently in larger sites a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign the headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size
the cemetery grounds are except in drier climates grass covered with a floral border around the headstones there is also an absence of any paving between the headstone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace however carter and jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and sanitises the nature of the war deaths
cross of sacrifice and stone of remembrance
typically cemeteries of more than 40 graves contain a cross of sacrifice designed by architect reginald blomfield this cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in churchyards in england with proportions more commonly seen in the celtic cross the cross is normally a freestanding four point limestone latin cross mounted on an octagonal base and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet a bronze longsword blade down is embedded on the face of the cross this cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery intended to link british soldiers and the christian concept of self sacrifice
cemeteries with more than 1000 burials typically have a stone of remembrance designed by edwin lutyens with the inscription their name liveth for evermore the concept of the stone of remembrance stone was developed by rudyard kipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively in contrast to the cross of sacrifice the design for the stone deliberately avoided shapes associated with particular religions the geometry of the structure was based on studies of the parthenon each stone is 3 5 metres 11 ft long and 1 5 metres 4 9 ft high the shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar the feature was designed using the principle of entasis the subtle curves in the design if extended would form a sphere 1 801 feet 8 inches 549 15 m in diameter
headstones
every grave is marked with a headstone each headstone contains the national emblem or regimental badge rank name unit date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives the headstones use a standard upper case lettering designed by macdonald gill individual graves are arranged where possible in straight rows and marked by uniform headstones the vast majority of which are made of portland stone the original headstone dimensions were 76 centimetres 30 in tall 38 cm 15 in wide and 7 6 cm 3 0 in thick
most headstones are inscribed with a cross except for those deceased known to be atheist or non christian in the case of burials of victoria cross or george cross recipients the regimental badge is supplemented by the victoria cross or george cross emblem sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement in such cases their primary name is shown along with the notation served as many headstones are for unidentified casualties they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body the epitaph developed by rudyard kipling that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is a soldier of the great war known unto god some headstones bear the text believed to be buried in this cemetery when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known in some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one headstone covers more than one grave the headstone does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date and even then only if it is known and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death
due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the commission to deviate from its standard design in places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes such as thailand and turkey stone faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones these measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground in italy headstones were carved from chiampo perla limestone because it was in more plentiful supply in struma military cemetery in greece to avoid risk of earthquake damage small headstones are laid flat on the ground the smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia
horticulture
commission cemeteries are distinctive in treating floriculture as an integral part of the cemetery design originally the horticultural concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting in contrast to traditionally bleak graveyards recommendations given by arthur william hill the assistant director of the royal botanical gardens at kew enabled the commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life combining structural and horticultural elements was not unfamiliar to the commission s architects sir edwin lutyens furthered his long standing working relationship with horticulturist gertrude jekyll whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and roses greatly influenced the appearance of the cemeteries where possible indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home
variety in texture height and timing of floral display were equally important horticultural considerations the beds around each headstone are planted with a mixture of floribunda roses and herbaceous perennials low growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain in cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers dwarf varieties of plants are used instead
the absence of any form of paving between the headstone rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs lawn paths add to the garden ambiance and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured by the commission s horticulturists as is the case in iraq drier areas require a different approach not only for lawns but also to plants and styles of planting similarly there are separate horticultural considerations in tropical climates when many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area like along the western front or gallipoli peninsula mobile teams of gardeners operate from a local base elsewhere larger cemeteries have their own dedicated staff while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part time

ongoing projects and issues
war graves photographic project
a project is underway to photograph the graves of and memorials to all service personnel from 1914 to the present day and make the images available to the public the work is being carried out by the war graves photographic project in conjunction with the cwgc as of august 2013 the project has recorded 1 7 million photographs for posterity
reburials and identifications
immediately following the first world war the british army remained responsible for the exhumation of remains the western front was divided into sectors and combed for bodies by 12 man exhumation units between the armistice and september 1921 the exhumation units reburied 204 695 bodies after 1921 no further widespread search for bodies was undertaken and in february 1921 responsibility of the cemeteries was transferred to the commission despite the rigorous searches bodies continued to be discovered in numbers in the three years following the conclusion of the general search 38 000 bodies were discovered in the mid 1920s 20 to 30 bodies were being discovered weekly
the discovery of remains of first and second world war casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually for example in 2006 eight bodies of canadian soldiers from the 78th battalion winnipeg grenadiers cef were discovered in a backyard in hallu france in april 2013 the remains of four british soldiers discovered by a french farmer clearing land with metal detector in 2009 were re interred at h a c cemetery near arras france in march 2014 the remains of 20 commonwealth and 30 german soldiers were discovered in vendin le vieil france with the commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied at loos british cemetery
when the remains of a commonwealth soldier from the first or second world war is discovered the commission is notified and a commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains the details are then registered and archived at the commission s headquarters the collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains anthropological data and dna the archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties in december 2013 it was discovered that second lieutenant philip frederick cormack who was previously commemorated on the arras flying services memorial had in fact been buried in a french military cemetery in machelen east flanders in belgium sergeant leonard maidment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to marfaux british cemetery discovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the hampshire regiment killed on 20 july 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in france on that date
vandalism
cemeteries including those of war dead are targets for vandalism the gravestones cemeteries and buildings of the commission are no exception the commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the pursuits partaken by young people noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays determined thieves will also steal the bronze swords off the cross of sacrifice which are now replaced with identical ones made in fibreglass
the vandalism of commission cemeteries has also been connected to the participation of commonwealth countries in contemporary conflicts in the 1970s in the troubles commission cemeteries in ireland experienced vandalism vandals defaced the central memorial of the taples military cemetery in northern france with anti british and anti american graffiti on 20 march 2003 immediately after the beginning of the iraq war on 9 may 2004 thirty three headstones were demolished in the gaza cemetery which contains 3 691 graves allegedly in retaliation for the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal on 24 february 2012 during the libyan civil war an islamist militia damaged over 200 headstones in the benghazi war cemetery as well as the central memorial
tatwine
tatwine or tatwin tatuini or tadwinus c 670 734 was the tenth archbishop of canterbury from 731 to 734 prior to becoming archbishop he was a monk and abbot of a benedictine monastery besides his ecclesiastical career tatwine was a writer and riddles he composed survive another work he composed was on the grammar of the latin language which was aimed at advanced students of that language he was subsequently considered a saint
biography
tatwine was a mercian by birth his epigraph at canterbury stated that when he died he was in old age so perhaps he was born around 670 he became a monk at the monastery at breedon on the hill in the present day county of leicestershire and then abbot of that house through the influence of king thelbald he was appointed as archbishop of canterbury in 731 and was consecrated on 10 june 731 he was one of a number of mercians who were appointed to canterbury during the 730s and 740s apart from his consecration of the bishops of lindsey and selsey in 733 tatwine s period as archbishop appears to have been uneventful he died in office on 30 july 734 later considered a saint his feast day is 30 july
writings
bede s commentary on tatwine calls him a vir religione et prudentia insignis sacris quoque literis nobiliter instructus a man notable for his prudence devotion and learning these qualities were displayed in the two surviving manuscripts of his riddles and four of his ars tatuini the ars is one of only two surviving 8th century latin grammars from england and was based on the works of priscian and consentius the riddles deal with such diverse topics as philosophy and charity the five senses and the alphabet and a book and a pen the riddles are formed in acrostics the grammar is a reworking of donatus s ars minor with the addition of information drawn from other grammarians it was not designed for a newcomer to the latin language but is designed for more advanced students it covers the eight parts of speech through illustrations drawn from classical scholars although not directly but through other grammatical works there are also some examples drawn from the psalms the work was completed before he became archbishop and was used not only in england but also on the continent a recent edition of his works is tatuini opera omnia published in 1968 with some translations into english and german from the original latin
german type ub i submarine
the type ub i was a class of small coastal submarines u boats built in germany at the beginning of the first world war 20 boats were constructed most of which went into service with the german imperial navy boats of this design were also operated by the austro hungarian navy kaiserliche und k nigliche kriegsmarine or k u k kriegsmarine and the bulgarian navy the group is sometimes known as the ub 1 class after sm ub 1 the class leader in the austro hungarian navy it was called the u 10 class
built to meet the need for small maneuverable submarines able to operate in the narrow shallow seas off flanders the vessels were intended to be quickly constructed then shipped by rail and assembled at their port of operation the design effort began in mid august 1914 and by mid october the first 15 boats were ordered from two german shipyards the german imperial navy subsequently ordered an additional pair of boats to replace two sold to austria hungary who ordered a further three boats in april 1915 a total of 20 ub is were built construction of the first boats for germany began in early november 1914 all 20 were completed by october 1915 several of the first boats underwent trials in german home waters but the rest were assembled and tested at either antwerp or pola the german boats operated primarily in the flanders baltic and constantinople flotillas the boats were about 28 metres 92 ft long and displaced 127 tonnes 125 long tons when surfaced and 142 tonnes 140 long tons while submerged all had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes and were equipped with a deck mounted machine gun
in 1918 four of the surviving german boats were converted into coastal minelayers of the seventeen boats in german service two were sold to austria hungary one was sold to bulgaria and nine were lost during the war one of the five austro hungarian boats was sunk and another mined and not repaired the five surviving german boats the four surviving austro hungarian boats and the bulgarian boat were all turned over to the allies after the end of the war and were broken up
design
in the earliest stages of the first world war the german army s rapid advance along the north sea coast found the german imperial navy without submarines suitable to operate in the narrow and shallow seas off flanders by 18 august 1914 two weeks after the german invasion of belgium the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun
the german imperial navy stipulated that the submarines must be transportable by rail which imposed a maximum diameter of 3 15 metres 10 ft 4 in the rushed planning effort which had been assigned the name project 34 resulted in the type ub i design created specifically for operation from flanders the boats were to be about 28 metres 92 ft long and to displace about 125 tonnes 123 long tons with two bow torpedo tubes
boats of the type ub i design were built by two manufacturers germaniawerft of kiel and ag weser of bremen which led to some variations in boats from the two shipyards the eight germaniawerft built boats were slightly longer at 28 10 metres 92 ft 2 in length overall while the twelve weser built boats came in 22 centimetres 8 7 in shorter than their counterparts all were 3 15 metres 10 ft 4 in abeam and had a draft of 3 03 metres 9 ft 11 in the boats all displaced 127 tonnes 125 long tons while surfaced but differed slightly in displacement submerged the slightly longer germaniawerft boats displaced 142 tonnes 140 long tons while submerged as they weighed 1 tonne 0 98 long tons more than the weser boats
the drivetrain of the boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a daimler germaniawerft or k rting weser diesel engine on the surface or a siemens schuckert electric motor for underwater travel the weser boats were capable of nearly 7 5 knots 13 9 km h 8 6 mph on the surface and a little more than 6 knots 11 km h 6 9 mph submerged the germaniawerft boats were about 1 knot 1 9 km h 1 2 mph slower than their bremen made counterparts the boats were equipped with two 45 centimetre 17 7 in bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes they were also armed with a single 8 millimetre 0 31 in machine gun affixed to the deck
construction
the german imperial navy ordered its first fifteen type ub i boats on 15 october 1914 eight boats numbered ub 1 to ub 8 were ordered from germaniawerft of kiel and seven boats numbered ub 9 to u 15 from ag weser of bremen after two of the class ub 1 and ub 15 were sold in february 1915 to ally austria hungary becoming u 10 and u 11 in the austro hungarian navy the german imperial navy ordered ub 16 and ub 17 from weser a further three for austria hungary u 15 u 16 and u 17 had been ordered from weser by april bringing the total number constructed to 20
ub 1 and ub 2 were laid down on 1 november 1914 at the germaniawerft yard at kiel ub 1 was launched on 22 january 1915 just 75 working days later ub 2 s launch followed on 13 february among the weser boats ub 9 was laid down first on 6 november 1914 and launched on 6 february 1915 a week ahead of ub 2 these first three boats launched underwent trials in home waters but most of the other members of the class were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point
the process of shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars type ub i boats destined for service with the flanders flotilla made a five day journey to antwerp for the two to three week assembly process after assembly at antwerp the boats were towed by barge to bruges for trials boats selected for service in the mediterranean were sent to the austro hungarian port of pola for assembly the total time from departure of the railcars from the shipyard to operational readiness for the boats was about six weeks
by july 1915 all seventeen of the german imperial navy type ub is had been completed
service
during their trials the type ub is were found to be too small and too slow and had a reputation for being underpowered one commander compared his type ub i to a sewing machine according to authors r h gibson and maurice prendergast in their 1931 book the german submarine war 1914 1918 the ubs did not have enough power to chase down steamers while surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any extended amount of time underwater exhausting their batteries after little over an hour s running in service use revealed another problem with a single propeller shaft engine combination if either component failed the u boat was almost totally disabled
another reported problem with the type ub is was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes the boats were equipped with compensating tanks designed to flood and offset the loss of the c 06 torpedo s 1 700 pound 770 kg weight but this system did not always function properly as a result when firing from periscope depth the boat could broach after firing or if too much weight was taken on plunge to the depths when ub 15 torpedoed and sank italian submarine medusa in june 1915 the tank failed to properly compensate forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance
despite the problems the tin tadpoles as the germans referred to them were in active service from march 1915 through the end of the war with half of the 20 boats lost during the war boats of the class served in three navies the german imperial navy the austro hungarian navy and the bulgarian navy in german service they served primarily in the flanders flotilla the baltic flotilla and the constantinople flotilla
german imperial navy
flanders flotilla
the first type ub i to enter service was ub 10 which formed the nucleus of the flanders flotilla on 27 march 1915 by the end of april five more type ub i boats had become operational ub 10 was eventually joined in the flanders flotilla by ub 2 ub 4 ub 5 ub 6 ub 12 ub 13 ub 16 and ub 17 of these only ub 2 made the journey to flanders by sea rather than rail
ub 4 departed on the first patrol from flanders on 9 april and was responsible for sinking the first ship sent down by the flotilla the type ub i boats of the flanders flotilla originally patrolled the area between the united kingdom and the netherlands but began patrolling the english channel after ub 6 pioneered a route past british antisubmarine nets and mines in the straits of dover in late june
over the type ub is first year of service ub 4 and ub 13 were both lost and ub 2 and ub 5 were transferred to the baltic flotilla in march 1917 ub 6 ran aground in dutch waters and was interned for the rest of the war along with her crew the four remaining type ub is in flanders ub 10 ub 12 ub 16 ub 17 were all converted to minelayers by 1918 having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with chutes to carry up to eight mines all but ub 10 were lost in 1918 ub 10 in poor repair and out of service was scuttled in october 1918 when the germans evacuated from flanders
baltic flotilla
ub 9 was initially assigned to the baltic flotilla and was joined by ub 2 and ub 5 in early 1916 all three became training boats at kiel in 1916 joining ub 11 in that duty little information is available about the type ub i boats operating in the baltic
constantinople flotilla
four of the german imperial navy boats ub 3 ub 7 ub 8 and ub 14 were selected for service with the constantinople flotilla all were sent to pola for assembly and trials there as part of the pola flotilla before sailing on to join the constantinople flotilla ub 3 disappeared en route to constantinople in may 1915 but the other three arrived there by mid june
the three type ub i boats of the constantinople flotilla seem to have patrolled primarily in the black sea ub 8 was transferred to the bulgarian navy in may 1916 and ub 7 disappeared in the black sea in october 1916 leaving ub 14 as the sole remaining german type ub i in the flotilla she was surrendered at sevastopol in november 1918 to french armies stationed there during the russian civil war
austro hungarian navy
ub 1 and the still incomplete ub 15 were sold to the austria hungary in february 1915 both were dismantled and shipped to pola in may after one cruise under the german flag each boat was commissioned into the austro hungarian navy the pair renamed u 10 and u 11 respectively were joined by u 15 u 16 and u 17 in october known as the u 10 or the okarina english ocarina class as a part of the austro hungarian navy the five boats operated primarily in the adriatic in patrols off italy and albania u 10 ex ub 1 hit a mine in july 1918 and was beached but had not been repaired by the end of the war u 16 was sunk after she torpedoed an italian destroyer in october 1916 and the remaining three and the unrepaired u 10 were ceded to italy at the end of the war
bulgarian navy
after ub 8 was transferred to the bulgarian navy in may 1916 she was renamed podvodnik no 18 in cyrillic o o no 18 she was bulgaria s first submarine and was engaged primarily in coastal defense duties off bulgaria s main black sea port of varna podvodnik no 18 survived the war and was ceded to france after the treaty of neuilly sur seine
list of type ub i submarines
20 type ub i submarines were built 17 for the german imperial navy and three for the austro hungarian navy two of the german submarines ub 1 and ub 15 were sold to austria hungary and commissioned into the austro hungarian navy as u 10 and u 11 respectively those two and a further three built by ag weser comprised the virtually identical u 10 class for the austro hungarian navy another of the german submarines ub 8 was sold to bulgaria in may 1916 becoming podvodnik no 18

the military history of gibraltar during world war ii exemplifies gibraltar s position as a british fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in british military strategy both as a foothold on the continent of europe and as a bastion of british sea power during world war ii gibraltar served a vital role in both the atlantic theatre and the mediterranean theatre controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the mediterranean sea from the atlantic ocean
in addition to its commanding position gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the atlantic and the mediterranean force h under the command of vice admiral james somerville was based in gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieged island of malta during the course of the war gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from vichy french aircraft and from aircraft of the italian royal air force regia aeronautica based on sardinia additionally the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the italian royal navy regia marina commando frogman unit decima flottiglia mas and their human torpedoes this italian unit was based on the interned italian ship ss olterra in the nearby spanish harbour of algeciras a number of attacks were also carried out by spanish and gibraltarian agents acting on behalf of the german abwehr
inside the rock of gibraltar itself miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone masses of rock were blasted out to build an underground city in huge man made caverns barracks offices and a fully equipped hospital were constructed complete with an operating theatre and x ray equipment
operation torch the allied invasion of french north africa in november 1942 was coordinated from the rock general dwight d eisenhower who was given command of the operation set up his headquarters in gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation following the successful completion of the north african campaign and the surrender of italy in 1943 gibraltar s role shifted from a forward operating base to a rear area supply position the harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the mediterranean until v e day in 1945
prelude and evacuation
world war ii dramatically changed the lives of gibraltarians the decision to enforce mass evacuation in order to increase the strength of the rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most gibraltarians some for up to ten years had nowhere to call home only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being british by sharing in the war effort
in early june 1940 about 13 500 evacuees were shipped to casablanca in french morocco however following the capitulation of the french to the german armies later in june 1940 the new pro german french vichy government found the presence of gibraltarian evacuees in casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal the opportunity soon arose when 15 british cargo vessels arrived under commodore crichton repatriating 15 000 french servicemen who had been rescued from dunkirk once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the evacuees although crichton was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships and contrary to british admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards he opened up his gangways for boarding just beforehand the british fleet had destroyed a number of french warships at mers el kebir in order to prevent them ending up in german hands the attack during which 1 297 french sailors died led to high tensions which were evident when families were forced at bayonet point by french troops to board taking only what they could carry leaving many possessions behind however when they arrived at gibraltar the governor would not allow them to land fearing that once the evacuees were back on the rock it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time crowds gathered in john mackintosh square in the centre of gibraltar as the news broke speeches were made and two city councillors accompanied by the acting president of the exchange and commercial library went to see the governor sir clive liddell to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land after receiving instructions from london a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the rock and by 13 july the re evacuation back to gibraltar had been completed
british conservative politician oliver stanley agreed to accept the evacuees in the united kingdom but he argued with gibraltar over the number of people involved the governor he declared had given the number of evacuees first as 13 000 then as 14 000 and finally as 16 000 he asked for the situation to be clarified stressing the shortage of accommodation in britain and insisting that only 13 000 could be accepted 2 000 of whom were to be sent to the portuguese atlantic island of madeira the situation replied general liddell on 19 july is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22 000 the 13 000 was the number sent to morocco and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered in london the evacuees were placed in the hands of the ministry of health and many were housed in kensington area concern for them in gibraltar mounted as the air raids against london intensified coupled with the arrival of harrowing letters describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living
in september rumours were already circulating among the evacuees and in gibraltar that the possibility of re evacuating the gibraltarians once more was being mooted this time the destination being jamaica in the west indies after much contention it was decided to send a party directly from gibraltar to the island and 1 093 evacuees left for jamaica direct on 9 october with more following later on however petitions followed and the demands were met partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping the situation at the end of 1940 therefore was that approximately 2 000 evacuees were in jamaica and a lesser number in madeira with the bulk of around 10 000 housed in the london area
royal air force involvement 1939 1941
construction of a solid surface runway began in late 1939 and in 1940 it was proposed to extend the existing runway to a length of 1 550 yards 1 417 m the land reclamation commenced towards the end of 1941 along with the construction of an raf camp at the north front now raf gibraltar the raf dispatched their next squadron to gibraltar at this time and it was in september 1939 that war with germany was declared and the strong possibility of german submarines concentrating in the strait of gibraltar and using spanish port facilities loomed large in admiralty thinking so at 09 00 utc on the 9 september 1939 no 202 squadron raf was ordered to gibraltar loaded to the gunwales with equipment
on 25 september 1939 no 200 coastal group was formed as a subordinate formation to hq raf mediterranean in control of no 202 sqn the group s function was the control of royal air force units operating from gibraltar in late 1940 the group was transferred to coastal command later a combined hq was formed which commenced operations in early 1942
vichy french attacks 1940
on 18 july 1940 after the attack on the french fleet at mers el k bir by the british the vichy government authorized a bombing raid of gibraltar as a response little damage was reported to have been done
on tuesday 24 september the italian stefani news agency reported as a reprisal for the bombardment of dakar yesterday morning one hundred and twenty french aircraft based in morocco attacked gibraltar on the same day the united press agency reported the french government has issued an official denial of reports according to which french aircraft were said to have attacked gibraltar up until now no reprisals have been undertaken but the united press report ended on an ominous note with french reprisals are imminent
again on the same day the vichy french government issued orders for the naval base and city of gibraltar to be bombarded as a result six bomber squadrons of the vichy french air force arm e de l air de vichy and four squadrons of the vichy french navy marine nationale de vichy were employed in the operation the 64 bombers flew from bases in oran tafaroui in algeria meknes mediouna and port lyautey in morocco the french action was approved by both the german armistice commission and the italian armistice commission
no british aircraft were encountered and much damage was done in the area south of the fortress the south mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged in the northern part of gibraltar fires broke out
on 25 september the french returned with a larger force of eighty three bombers to cause additional damage to the naval base and harbour installations again aircraft of the british royal air force made no appearance however the french crews did report encountering heavy anti aircraft fire one leo 451 bomber was lost and 13 other aircraft were lightly damaged during the two days of bombing attacks the british armed trawler hmt stella sirius was sunk by bombs
the air attack on 25 september was the last by vichy forces on gibraltar
operation felix 1940 1941
the rock came through the war relatively unscathed but given its strategic importance germany made plans to capture gibraltar codenamed felix the plan which was signed by adolf hitler himself was formulated at the highest level of command with or without permission germany would take entry through spain and attack gibraltar driving the british out of the western mediterranean the strait would be effectively closed to the allies once gibraltar was in german hands forcing asia bound allied shipping to steam all the way around africa rather than to proceed to the east via the shorter route through the mediterranean and the suez canal the rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving france but landing afterward at spanish air bases to deny a possible spanish capture of the base the german planners decided that the final attack to seize gibraltar was to be made by german troops alone
diplomatic failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of 1941 which had been drawn up in detail by the wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of 1940
general ludwig k bler s xlix corps would conduct the actual attack on the rock the assault forces would comprise the infantry regiment gro deutschland the 98th regiment of the 1st mountain division 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions three observation battalions three engineer battalions two smoke battalions a detachment of 150 brandenburgers and up to 150 miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles goliaths packed with high explosives
as part of a combined force operation the german air force luftwaffe would contribute ju 88as stukas messerschmitts three light aa battalions and three heavy aa battalions nazi germany s kriegsmarine would cooperate by using u boats to interfere with british naval movement and emplacing coastal batteries to further discourage the royal navy
on 10 march 1941 with operation barbarossa looming felix was amended to operation felix heinrich whereby german troops would be withdrawn from the ussr to capture gibraltar as a result of spanish dictator francisco franco s intransigence the operation was postponed modified and ultimately abandoned
italian bombing of gibraltar
from sardinia italian piaggio p 108 bombers attacked gibraltar several times mainly in 1942 the last raids on gibraltar were done during the 1943 allied landing in algeria when those bombers hit successfully even the oran port
the only unit of the regia aeronautica royal air force ever to fly the piaggio p 108 was the 274th long range bombardment squadron this unit was formed in may 1941 around the first machines that came off the assembly lines the training of the crews lasted far longer than anticipated and only in june 1942 the 274th became operational the most spectacular raids with the p 108 bombers were flown in october 1942 when several night attacks against gibraltar were undertaken from sardinia
after the armistice of cassibile 8 september the german allied italian social republic launched at least two raids on gibraltar one on the night of 4 5 june 1944 with ten sm 79bis aircraft and another on 6 june with nine aircraft both sorties were undertaken by the gruppo aerosiluranti buscaglia faggioni
italian frogmen raids 1940 1943
known as the floating trojan horse of gibraltar decima flottiglia mas an italian commando frogman unit created during the fascist government engaged in numerous attacks against the harbour at gibraltar
gibraltar was a very tempting target for the italians who saw it as a refuge for british warships and allied merchant shipping the italian frogmen originally used a spanish villa villa carmela located two miles 3 km from gibraltar owned by an italian officer who had married a spanish woman named conchita ramognino their base was shifted later to the italian tanker ss olterra interned in algeciras
abwehr saboteurs from spain
lesser known than the italian actions were the sabotage operations and limpet mine attacks carried out by spanish and gibraltarian agents recruited in the campo de gibraltar by the germans the abwehr contacted a spanish staff officer from campo de gibraltar lieutenant colonel eleuterio s nchez rubio a spanish officer member of the falange and coordinator of the intelligence operations in the campo to establish a network of saboteurs with access to gibraltar s nchez rubio designated emilio plazas tejera also a member of falange as operations chief of the organisation most of the recruits for the sabotage operations were spaniards from the campo a combination of financial reward ideological commitment and some threats and intimidation were used to gather a significant number of agents according to the british intelligence there were at least 183 spaniards and gibraltarians involved in the espionage and sabotage operations against gibraltar
sabotage operations were ordered from berlin in the late autumn of 1940 but actual work did not start until early 1941 the first operations were unsuccessful a first attempt to smuggle a bomb into gibraltar was aborted as the timing device was faulty in february there was a large explosion in the north tunnel and in april a bomb blew up near the airfield in june 1941 however the british intelligence foiled a new attempt by a german agent to attach a mine alongside an allied cargo ship another attempt failed when plazas placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive it was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed in january 1942 two spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the north front landing strip
financed trained and equipped by the germans the saboteurs sank the armed trawler hmt erin and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper hmt honju which resulted in the deaths of six british seamen on 18 january 1942 plazas was assisted by the spanish naval commander of puente mayorga manuel romero hume who allowed him to beach a rowboat there the british intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations in march 1942 a gibraltarian jos key one of the most prominent agents working for the germans responsible for the collection of information on military movements for the abwehr was arrested and executed in wandsworth prison in late 1942 by september 1942 plazas whose activities were closely monitored by the british at that time resigned and left carlos calvo his second in command in charge of the operations in late 1942 the german headquarters in berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded in early 1943 the arrival of an experienced head of abwehr operations in spain improved the outreach of the operations
in march 1943 an ammunition dump was blown up by calvo s agents the british growing suspicious of some of the saboteurs banned them from entering gibraltar this forced the abwehr to ask calvo for new personnel a spaniard working on the rock jos mart n mu oz was responsible for the explosion and fire at a large fuel tank at coaling island on 30 june 1943 this mission however would be the first and the last for mu oz because he was cornered and arrested by british authorities in august when he tried to smuggle a bomb into a weapons magazine inside ragged staff cave after being sentenced to death he was hanged on 11 january 1944 in gibraltar by british executioner albert pierrepoint a member of an unrelated abwehr sabotage network luis l pez cord n cuenca also arrested in 1943 was executed by pierrepoint on the same day calvo himself was put under arrest by the spanish police and neutralized he would be a free man again in december when he rejoined the abwehr in madrid under direct orders of wolfgang blaum aka baumann head of the sabotage section in spain after a falangist attempt against the life of pro allied general jos enrique varela perpetrated by s nchez rubio network s agent juan jos dom nguez and a meeting between anthony eden and the spanish ambassador at london jacobo fitz james stuart abwehr activities around gibraltar came to an end
operation tracer 1941 1942
operation tracer was a top secret british stay behind spying mission that was only to be implemented if gibraltar was captured by the axis powers six men were to be sealed in a cave and left with only enough supplies for a year the volunteers two doctors three signalmen and their leader would run an observation post with one 12 inch 300 mm by 6 inch 150 mm slit looking over the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace over the mediterranean the team would then wire back all shipping movements to the british admiralty
they were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the brick floor only if germany was defeated within their first year would they be released
as the threat of invasion was clearly felt in late 1941 an idea for a series of secret observation posts first in gibraltar and later in other places like malta and aden was put together under operation tracer
work in gibraltar began immediately under commander geoffrey birley and his chief engineer colonel fordham the site chosen at lord airey s battery on the southern tip of the rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter extensive trials of the equipment began in january 1942 under the eye of mi6 radio expert colonel richard gambier parry much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task a member of scott s ill fated expedition to the antarctic george murray levick was called up as surgeon commander to advise on survival techniques there were practical matters such as diet exercise sanitation and clothing to consider as well as vital psychology of the personnel the full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation a comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars however operation tracer was never needed as adolf hitler turned his attention away from gibraltar and towards the eastern front
the operation had been clouded in mystery until the discovery of papers at the public record office in kew uk previously in the 1960s details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as operation monkey yet facts were very sparse
in 1997 stay behind cave as it was nicknamed was discovered in gibraltar by the gibraltar caving group but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission the discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years
in november 2006 jim crone and sergeant major pete jackson senior tunnel guide with the royal gibraltar regiment met possibly the only member of operation tracer still alive when they travelled to meet dr w a bruce cooper at his home in england cooper 92 at the time provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a surgeon lieutenant in the royal navy volunteer reserve rnvr he recalled stories about his colleagues his training and his feelings about the task
mediterranean u boat campaign 1941 1944
the mediterranean u boat campaign lasted approximately from 21 september 1941 to may 1944 the kriegsmarine tried to isolate gibraltar malta and suez and disrupt britain s trade routes more than sixty u boats were sent to interdict allied shipping in the mediterranean sea many of these u boats were themselves attacked negotiating the strait of gibraltar controlled by britain nine u boats were sunk while attempting passage and ten more were damaged
north african campaign 1942
plans for the allied counter offensive after the attack on pearl harbor were ongoing by mid 1942 an invasion of europe in 1943 would be unworkable but the allies could attack the soft underbelly of europe through the mediterranean as prime minister winston churchill put it devised by president franklin roosevelt and churchill and code named operation torch the plan was to occupy french north africa morocco algeria and tunisia from these french colonies attacks could be launched that would drive italy out of the war
in july 1942 lieutenant general dwight d eisenhower was appointed allied commander in chief of operation torch churchill placed gibraltar under the command of general eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this the first large scale anglo american operation of the war he arrived in gibraltar on 5 november 1942 to take over not just command of operation torch itself but also military command of gibraltar
general eisenhower stayed at the convent the official governor s residence but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the rock in his memoirs general eisenhower wrote
the subterranean passages under the rock provided the sole available office space and in them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces the eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially pierced by feeble electric bulbs damp cold air in block long passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respond to the clattering efforts of electric fans through the arched ceilings came a constant drip drip drip of surface water that faithfully but drearily ticked off the seconds of the interminable almost unendurable wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the moment action begins
one hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transports converged on gibraltar more than 400 aircraft of all types were crammed into the dispersal areas around the gibraltar runway fighters had been shipped in crates and assembled on the airfield every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition fuel and other essential supplies 168 american pilots were housed in the raf messes at north front
on 8 november 1942 466 aircraft from gibraltar landed on captured north african airfields
from their headquarters in gibraltar general eisenhower and admiral sir andrew browne cunningham directed operation torch the first major combined combat operation during world war ii involving american and british forces
war tunnels
given that gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the rock of gibraltar this town inside the rock contained its own power station water supply and hospital some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end two canadian engineer companies the only soldiers with diamond tipped drills and 5 british engineer companies added some 30 miles 48 km of such tunnels a feat thought impossible at the time that was enough to hold all 30 000 troops on the rock today the rock has more underground tunnels than roads
death of w adys aw sikorski 1943
on 4 july 1943 a liberator bomber from raf transport command took off from gibraltar for england on board was general w adys aw sikorski prime minister of poland s london based government in exile and commander in chief of its armed forces returning from visiting polish troops in the middle east
the aircraft climbed normally from the runway levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour the 62 year old general died along with 15 others the sole survivor was the czech born pilot eduard prchal who was rescued by an raf launch the bodies of five passengers and crew including sikorski s daughter were never found
the coffins of general sikorski and his chief of staff general kilimecki were draped in the polish national flag and lay in state in the cathedral of st mary the crowned after a requiem mass the bodies were carried in procession to the h m dockyard with full military honours to be shipped to london in anticipation that general sikorski s remains would one day be returned to a liberated poland the route to the dockyard was lined by british troops and the coffins carried and escorted by polish servicemen
investigation
in 1943 a british court of inquiry investigated the crash of sikorski s liberator ii al523 but was unable to determine the probable cause finding only that it was an accident and the aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established a popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to jamming aircraft controls despite this finding the political context of the event coupled with a variety of curious circumstances immediately gave rise to speculation that sikorski s death had been no accident and may in fact have been the direct result of a soviet british or even polish conspiracy
aftermath
the surrender of italy in september 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of the evacuees to the rock as a result a resettlement board was established in november and at a meeting of the board on 8 february 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed on 6 april 1944 the first group of 1 367 repatriates arrived on the rock directly from the united kingdom and on 28 may the first repatriation party left madeira and by the end of 1944 only 520 non priority evacuees remained on the island
in london home comers were making claims on the evacuees wartime accommodation and 500 gibraltarians were re evacuated to scotland and 3 000 to camps in northern ireland although the governor lt general sir noel mason macfarlane fought valiantly on behalf of the evacuees and did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays as late as 1947 there were still 2 000 in northern irish camps the last of the evacuees did not see the rock again until 1951

nerva
nerva latin marcus cocceius nerva caesar augustus 8 november 30 ad 27 january 98 ad was roman emperor from 96 to 98 nerva became emperor at the age of sixty five after a lifetime of imperial service under nero and the rulers of the flavian dynasty under nero he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the pisonian conspiracy of 65 later as a loyalist to the flavians he attained consulships in 71 and 90 during the reigns of vespasian and domitian respectively
on 18 september 96 domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the praetorian guard and several of his freedmen on the same day nerva was declared emperor by the roman senate this was the first time the senate elected a roman emperor as the new ruler of the roman empire he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the autocratic government of domitian
nerva s brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the roman army a revolt by the praetorian guard in october 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir after some deliberation nerva adopted trajan a young and popular general as his successor after barely fifteen months in office nerva died of natural causes on 27 january 98 upon his death he was succeeded and deified by trajan
although much of his life remains obscure nerva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians nerva s greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death thus founding the nerva antonine dynasty
early career
family
marcus cocceius nerva was born in the village of narni 50 kilometers north of rome to the family of marcus cocceius nerva suffect consul in 40 and sergia plautilla ancient sources report the date as either 30 or 35 he had at least one attested sister named cocceia who married lucius salvius titianus otho the brother of the future emperor otho
like vespasian the founder of the flavian dynasty nerva was a member of the italian nobility rather than one of the elite of rome nevertheless the cocceii were among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late republic and early empire attaining consulships in each successive generation the direct ancestors of nerva on his father s side all named marcus cocceius nerva were associated with imperial circles since the time of emperor augustus 27 bc ad 14
his great grandfather was consul in 36 bc in replacement and abdicated and governor of asia in the same year his grandfather became consul suffect in july of either 21 or 22 and was known as a personal friend of emperor tiberius ad 14 37 accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on capri from 23 onwards dying in 33 nerva s father finally attained the consulship in 40 under emperor caligula 37 41 the cocceii were connected with the julio claudian dynasty through the marriage of sergia plautilla s brother octavius laenas and rubellia bassa the great granddaughter of tiberius
imperial service
not much of nerva s early life or career is recorded but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career he was praetor elect in the year 65 and like his ancestors moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist as an advisor to emperor nero he successfully helped detect and expose the pisonian conspiracy of 65 exactly what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable since they earned him rewards equal to those of nero s guard prefect tigellinus he received triumphal honors which was usually reserved for military victories and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace
according to the contemporary poet martial nero also held nerva s literary abilities in high esteem hailing him as the tibullus of our time another prominent member of nero s entourage was vespasian an old and respected general who had celebrated military triumphs during the 40s it appears vespasian befriended nerva during his time as an imperial advisor and may have asked him to watch over vespasian s youngest son domitian when vespasian departed for the jewish war in 67
the suicide of nero on 9 june 68 brought the julio claudian dynasty to an end leading to the chaotic year of the four emperors which saw the successive rise and fall of the emperors galba otho and vitellius until the accession of vespasian on 21 december 69 virtually nothing is known of nerva s whereabouts during 69 but despite the fact that otho was his brother in law he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the flavians
for services unknown he was rewarded with a consulship early in vespasian s reign in 71 this was a remarkable honour not only because he held this office early under the new regime but also because it was an ordinary consulship instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship making him one of the few non flavians to be honoured in this way under vespasian after 71 nerva again disappears from historical record presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under vespasian 69 79 and his sons titus 79 81 and domitian 81 96
he re emerges during the revolt of saturninus in 89 on 1 january 89 the governor of germania superior lucius antonius saturninus and his two legions at mainz legio xiv gemina and legio xxi rapax revolted against the roman empire with the aid of a tribe of the chatti the governor of germania inferior lappius maximus moved to the region at once assisted by the procurator of rhaetia titus flavius norbanus within twenty four days the rebellion was crushed and its leaders at mainz savagely punished the mutinous legions were sent to the front of illyricum while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded
domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with nerva again the honour suggested nerva had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the pisonian conspiracy under nero alternatively domitian may have selected nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status quo of the regime the revolt had been suppressed and the empire could return to order
emperor
accession
on 18 september 96 domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organised by court officials the fasti ostienses the ostian calendar records that the same day the senate proclaimed marcus cocceius nerva emperor despite his political experience this was a remarkable choice nerva was old and childless and had spent much of his career out of the public light prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in domitian s assassination
according to cassius dio the conspirators approached nerva as a potential successor prior to the assassination which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot suetonius by contrast does not mention nerva but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness considering the works of suetonius were published under nerva s direct descendants trajan and hadrian it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder on the other hand nerva lacked widespread support in the empire and as a known flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators the precise facts have been obscured by history but modern historians believe nerva was proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the senate within hours after the news of the assassination broke
although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless furthermore he had close connections with the flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the senate nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of nero he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts he accepted the decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war but neither the senate nor nerva appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against domitian
following the accession of nerva as emperor the senate passed damnatio memoriae on domitian his coins and statues were melted his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records in many instances existing portraits of domitian such as those found on the cancelleria reliefs were simply recarved to fit the likeness of nerva this allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material in addition the vast palace which domitian had erected on the palatine hill known as the flavian palace was renamed the house of the people and nerva himself took up residence in vespasian s former villa in the gardens of sallust
administration
the change of government was welcome particularly to the senators who had been harshly persecuted during domitian s reign as an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters nerva publicly swore that no senators would be put to death as long as he remained in office he called an end to trials based on treason released those who had been imprisoned under these charges and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled
all properties which had been confiscated by domitian were returned to their respective families nerva also sought to involve the senate in his government but this was not entirely successful he continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro domitianic faction of the senate he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life
having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the senate nerva had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the roman populace as was custom by this time a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army accordingly a congiarium of 75 denarii per head was bestowed upon the citizens while the soldiers of the praetorian guard received a donativum which may have amounted to as much as 5000 denarii per person this was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most needy romans
to the poorest nerva granted allotments of land worth up to 60 million sesterces he exempted parents and their children from a 5 inheritance tax and he made loans to italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of 5 to their municipality to support the children of needy families alimentary schemes which were later expanded by trajan antoninus pius and marcus aurelius furthermore numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to roman provinces namely he probably abolished the fiscus iudaicus the additional tax which all jews throughout the empire had to pay some of his coins bear the legend fisci iudaici calumnia sublata abolition of malicious prosecution regarding the jewish tax
before long nerva s expenses strained the economy of rome and although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by syme necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce expenditures the most superfluous religious sacrifices games and horse races were abolished while new income was generated from domitian s former possessions including the auctioning of ships estates and even furniture large amounts of money were obtained from domitian s silver and gold statues and nerva forbade that similar images be made in his honor
because he reigned only briefly nerva s public works were few instead completing projects which had been initiated under flavian rule this included extensive repairs to the roman road system and the expansion of the aqueducts the latter program was headed by the former consul sextus julius frontinus who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work on rome s water supply de aquis urbis romae the only major landmarks constructed under nerva were a granary known as the horrea nervae and a small imperial forum begun by domitian which linked the forum of augustus to the temple of peace little remains partly because the via dei fori imperiali cuts across it
crisis of succession
despite nerva s measures to remain popular with the senate and the roman people support for domitian remained strong in the army which had called for his deification immediately after the assassination in an attempt to appease the soldiers of the praetorian guard nerva had dismissed their prefect titus petronius secundus one of the chief conspirators against domitian and replaced him with a former commander casperius aelianus
likewise the generous donativum bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change the praetorians considered these measures insufficient however and demanded the execution of domitian s assassins which nerva refused continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the gravest crisis of nerva s reign
while the swift transfer of power following domitian s death had prevented a civil war from erupting nerva s position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority upon his accession he had ordered a halt to treason trials but at the same time allowed the prosecution of informers by the senate to continue this measure led to chaos as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies leading the consul fronto to famously remark that domitian s tyranny was ultimately preferable to nerva s anarchy early in 97 a conspiracy led by the senator gaius calpurnius piso crassus frugi licinianus failed but once again nerva refused to put the conspirators to death much to the disapproval of the senate
the situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor made more pressing because of nerva s old age and sickness he had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives who were unsuited for political office a successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the empire and it appears that by 97 nerva was considering to adopt marcus cornelius nigrinus curiatius maternus the powerful governor of syria this was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander marcus ulpius traianus commonly known as trajan a general of the armies at the german frontier
in october 97 these tensions came to a head when the praetorian guard led by casperius aelianus laid siege to the imperial palace and took nerva hostage he was forced to submit to their demands agreeing to hand over those responsible for domitian s death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious praetorians titus petronius secundus and parthenius domitian s former chamberlain were sought out and killed nerva was unharmed in this assault but his authority was damaged beyond repair
he realized that his position was no longer tenable without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of trajan as his successor and with this decision all but abdicated trajan was formally bestowed with the title of caesar and shared the consulship with nerva in 98
contrary to the view here popularized by cassius dio however nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor faced with a major crisis he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation the only candidate with sufficient military experience consular ancestry and connections was trajan likewise edward gibbon s assertion that nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the five good emperors has found little support among modern historians
death and legacy
on 1 january 98 at the start of his fourth consulship nerva suffered a stroke during a private audience shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the gardens of sallust on 28 january he was deified by the senate and his ashes were laid to rest in the mausoleum of augustus
nerva was succeeded without incident by his adopted son trajan who was greeted by the roman populace with much enthusiasm according to pliny the younger trajan dedicated a temple in honour of nerva yet no trace of it has ever been found nor was a commemorative series of coins for the deified nerva issued until ten years after his death according to cassius dio however the guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against nerva casperius aelianus was dismissed upon trajan s accession
due to the lack of written sources on this period much of nerva s life has remained obscure the most substantial surviving account of the reign of nerva was written by the 3rd century historian cassius dio his roman history which spans nearly a millennium from the arrival of aeneas in italy until the year 229 was composed more than one hundred years after nerva had died further details are added by an abridged biography from the epitome de caesaribus a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th century historian aurelius victor
a more comprehensive text presumed to describe the life of nerva in closer detail is the histories by the contemporary historian tacitus the histories is an account of the history of rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperor nero in 69 until the death of domitian in 96 unfortunately a substantial part of the work has been lost with only the first five books covering the year of the four emperors remaining in the introduction to his biography of gnaeus julius agricola however tacitus speaks highly of nerva describing his reign as the dawn of a most happy age when nerva caesar blended things once irreconcilable sovereignty and freedom
the surviving histories speak equally positively of nerva s brief reign although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies both cassius dio and aurelius victor emphasize his wisdom and moderation with dio commending his decision to adopt trajan as his heir these views were later popularized by the 18th century historian edward gibbon in his history of the decline and fall of the roman empire gibbon considered nerva the first of the five good emperors five successive rulers under whom the roman empire was governed by absolute power under the guidance of wisdom and virtue from 96 until 180 nevertheless even gibbon notes that compared to his successors nerva may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign
modern history has expanded upon this sentiment characterizing nerva as a well intentioned but weak and ineffectual ruler the roman senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule but nerva s mismanagement of the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought rome near the edge of a significant crisis the mutiny led by casperius aelianus was never intended as a coup but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor the adoption of trajan expanded his power base with a respected reliable general as his successor murison concludes that nerva s real talents were in fact ill suited to the emperorship
his place in roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary if tumultuous stop gap before the trajanic antonine dynasties it is a fact of irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign the forum of nerva ultimately became known as the forum transitorium or transitional forum
two modern statues which commemorate nerva can be found in towns associated with him there is an equestrian statue in gloucester england a town which was founded in his honour it is at the entrance to southgate street there is also a statue at his alleged birthplace narni in italy at cocceio nerva street

cast
cast notes
pool champion willie mosconi has a cameo appearance as willie who holds the stakes for eddie and fats s games mosconi s hands also appear in many of the closeup shots
production
the tevis novel had been optioned several times including by frank sinatra but attempts to adapt it for the screen were unsuccessful director rossen s daughter carol rossen speculates that previous adaptations focused too much on the pool aspects of the story and not enough on the human interaction rossen who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool themed play called corner pocket optioned the book and teamed with sidney carroll to produce the script
according to bobby darin s agent martin baum paul newman s agent turned down the part of fast eddie newman was originally unavailable to play fast eddie regardless being committed to star opposite elizabeth taylor in the film two for the seesaw rossen offered darin the part after seeing him on the mike wallace interview when taylor was forced to drop out of seesaw because of shooting overruns on cleopatra newman was freed up to take the role which he accepted after reading just half of the script no one associated with the production officially notified darin or his representatives that he had been replaced they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race
rossen filmed the hustler over six weeks entirely in new york city much of the action was filmed at two now defunct pool halls mcgirr s and ames billiard academy other shooting locations included a townhouse on east 82nd street which served as the louisville home of murray hamilton s character findley and the manhattan greyhound bus terminal the film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders willie mosconi served as technical advisor on the film and shot a number of the trick shots in place of the actors all of gleason s shots were his own they were filmed in wide angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames rossen in pursuit of the style he termed neo neo realistic hired actual street thugs enrolled them in the screen actors guild and used them as extras scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at ames pool hall establishing that eddie is on his way to town originally slated to be the first scene of the film and a longer scene of preacher talking to bert at johnny s bar which establishes preacher is a junkie
early shooting put more focus on the pool playing but during filming rossen made the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between newman and laurie s characters despite the change in emphasis rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of eddie s character and the evolution of his relationship to bert and sarah through the positioning of the characters in the frame for example when eddie is playing findley eddie is positioned below bert in a two shot but above findley while still below bert in a three shot when sarah enters the room she is below eddie in two shot while in a three shot eddie is still below bert when eddie is kneeling over sarah s body bert again appears above him but eddie attacks bert ending up on top of him eddie finally appears above bert in two shot when eddie returns to beat fats
themes
the hustler is fundamentally a story of what it means to be a human being couched within the context of winning and losing describing the film robert rossen said my protagonist fast eddie wants to become a great pool player but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being he attains self awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused and then he wins his pool game roger ebert concurs with this assessment citing the hustler as one of the few american movies in which the hero wins by surrendering by accepting reality instead of his dreams
the film was also somewhat autobiographical for rossen relating to his dealings with the house un american activities committee a screenwriter during the 1930s and 40s he had been involved with the communist party in the 1930s and refused to name names at his first huac appearance ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members similarly felson sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in a faustian pact to gain character
film and theatre historian ethan mordden has identified the hustler as one of a handful of films from the early 1960s that re defined the relationship of films to their audiences this new relationship he writes is one of challenge rather than flattery of doubt rather than certainty no film of the 1950s mordden asserts took such a brutal clear look at the ego affirmation of the one on one contest at the inhumanity of the winner or the castrated vulnerability of the loser although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic film noir mordden rejects the comparison based on rossen s ultra realistic style also noting that the film lacks noir s treacherous woman or its relish in discovering crime among the bourgeoisie hungry bank clerks and lusty wives mordden does note that while fast eddie has a slight fifties ring the character makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily feeling tough guys of the rebel era b ut he does end up seeking out his emotions and telling bert that he is a loser because he s dead inside
reception
the hustler had its world premiere in washington d c on september 25 1961 prior to the premiere richard burton hosted a midnight screening of the film for the casts of the season s broadway shows which generated a great deal of positive word of mouth initially reluctant to publicize the film 20th century fox responded by stepping up its promotional activities
the film was well received by critics although with the occasional caveat variety praised the performances of the entire main cast but felt that the sordid aspects of the story prevented the film from achieving the goal of being pure entertainment variety also felt the film was far too long stanley kauffmann writing for the new republic concurred in part with this assessment kauffmann strongly praised the principal cast calling newman first rate and writing that scott s was his most credible performance to date laurie he writes gives her part movingly anguished touches although he also mildly criticizes her for over reliance on method acting while he found that the script strains hard to give an air of menace and criminality to the pool hall and also declares it full of pseudo meaning kauffmann lauds rossen s sure economical direction especially in regard to gleason who he says does not so much act as pose for a number of pictures which are well arranged by rossen it is the best use of a manikin by a director since kazan photographed burl ives as big daddy the new york times despite finding that the film strays a bit and that the romance between newman and laurie s characters seems a mite far fetched nonetheless found that the hustler speaks powerfully in a universal language that spellbinds and reveals bitter truths
the hustler received nine academy award nominations the film won two for best art direction set decoration black and white harry horner and gene callahan and best cinematography black and white eugen sch fftan the film was also nominated for best picture and newman was nominated for best actor in a leading role gleason and scott were both nominated for best actor in a supporting role scott refused the nomination laurie was nominated for best actress in a leading role rossen received nominations for best director and with carroll for best writing screenplay based on material from another medium
newman was nominated for a golden globe award for best actor gleason and scott were each nominated for best supporting actor and scott was also nominated as best new star of the year at the 1962 bafta awards the hustler tied with the soviet film ballad of a soldier for best film from any source newman won for best foreign actor and piper laurie was nominated for best foreign actress gleason was honored as best supporting actor by the national board of review of motion pictures and the film was named among the board s ten best films of 1961 rossen was named best director by the new york film critics circle awards and rossen and carroll shared the writers guild of america award for best written drama

legacy
in the decades since its release the hustler has cemented its reputation as a classic roger ebert echoing earlier praise for the performances direction and cinematography and adding laurels for editor dede allen cites the film as one of those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories he further cites fast eddie felson as one of only a handful of movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as touchstones tv guide calls the film a dark stunner offering a grim world whose only bright spot is the top of the pool table yet with characters who maintain a shabby nobility and grace the four leads are again lavishly praised for their performances and the film is summed up as not to be missed
paul newman reprised his role as fast eddie felson in the 1986 film the color of money for which he won the academy award for best actor in a leading role a number of observers and critics have suggested that this oscar was in belated recognition for his performance in the hustler in 1997 the library of congress selected the hustler for preservation in the united states national film registry as culturally historically or aesthetically significant carroll and rossen s screenplay was selected by the writers guild of america in 2006 as the 96th best motion picture screenplay of all time in june 2008 afi released its ten top ten the best ten films in ten classic american film genres after polling over 1 500 people from the creative community the hustler was acknowledged as the sixth best film in the sports genre
the hustler is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity of pool in the united states which had been on the decline for decades the film also brought recognition to willie mosconi who despite having won multiple world championships was virtually unknown to the general public perhaps the greatest beneficiary of the film s popularity was a real life pool hustler named rudolf wanderone mosconi claimed in an interview at the time of the film s release that the character of minnesota fats was based on wanderone who at the time was known as new york fatty wanderone immediately adopted the minnesota fats nickname and parlayed his association with the film into book and television deals and other ventures author walter tevis denied for the rest of his life that wanderone had played any role in the creation of the character other players would claim with greater or lesser degrees of credibility to have served as models for fast eddie including ronnie allen ed taylor ed parker and eddie pelkey
homarus gammarus
homarus gammarus known as the european lobster or common lobster is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern atlantic ocean mediterranean sea and parts of the black sea it is closely related to the american lobster h americanus it may grow to a length of 60 cm 24 in and a mass of 6 kilograms 13 lb and bears a conspicuous pair of claws in life the lobsters are blue only becoming lobster red on cooking mating occurs in the summer producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food and is widely caught using lobster pots mostly around the british isles
description
homarus gammarus is a large crustacean with a body length up to 60 centimetres 24 in and weighing up to 5 6 kilograms 11 13 lb although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 38 cm 9 15 in long and weigh 0 7 2 2 kg 1 5 4 9 lb like other crustaceans lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow in a process called ecdysis moulting this may occur several times a year for young lobsters but decreases to once every 1 2 years for larger animals
the first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large asymmetrical pair of claws the larger one is the crusher and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey the other is the cutter which has sharp inner edges and is used for holding or tearing the prey usually the left claw is the crusher and the right is the cutter
the exoskeleton is generally blue above with spots that coalesce and yellow below the red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking this occurs because in life the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking releasing the red pigment
the closest relative of h gammarus is the american lobster homarus americanus the two species are very similar and can be crossed artificially although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap the two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics
the rostrum of h americanus bears one or more spines on the underside which are lacking in h gammarus
the spines on the claws of h americanus are red or red tipped while those of h gammarus are white or white tipped
the underside of the claw of h americanus is orange or red while that of h gammarus is creamy white or very pale red
life cycle
female h gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 85 millimetres 3 1 3 3 in whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female whose shell is therefore soft and a hard shelled male the female carries the eggs for up to 12 months depending on the temperature attached to her pleopods females carrying eggs are said to be berried and can be found throughout the year
the eggs hatch at night and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents preying on zooplankton this stage involves three moults and lasts for 15 35 days after the third moult the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult and adopts a benthic lifestyle the juveniles are rarely seen in the wild and are poorly known although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows it is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 000 survives to the benthic phase when they reach a carapace length of 15 mm 0 59 in the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives
distribution
homarus gammarus is found across the north eastern atlantic ocean from northern norway to the azores and morocco not including the baltic sea it is also present in most of the mediterranean sea only missing from the section east of crete and along only the north west coast of the black sea the northernmost populations are found in the norwegian fjords tysfjorden and nordfolda inside the arctic circle
the species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations one widespread population and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes possibly due to adaptation to the local environment the first of these is the population of lobsters from northern norway which have been referred to as the midnight sun lobster the populations in the mediterranean sea are distinct from those in the atlantic ocean the last distinct population is found in the netherlands samples from the oosterschelde were distinct from those collected in the north sea or english channel
attempts have been made to introduce h gammarus to new zealand alongside other european species such as the edible crab cancer pagurus between 1904 and 1914 one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in dunedin but the species did not become established there
ecology
adult h gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 150 metres 0 492 ft although not normally deeper than 50 m 160 ft they prefer hard substrates such as rocks or hard mud and live in holes or crevices emerging at night to feed
the diet of h gammarus mostly consists of other benthic invertebrates these include crabs molluscs sea urchins starfish and polychaete worms
the three clawed lobster species homarus gammarus h americanus and nephrops norvegicus are hosts to the three known species of the animal phylum cycliophora the species on h gammarus has not been described
homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease gaffkaemia caused by the bacterium aerococcus viridans although it is frequently found in american lobsters the disease has only been seen in captive h gammarus where prior occupation of the tanks by h americanus could not be ruled out
human consumption
homarus gammarus is traditionally highly esteemed as a foodstuff and was mentioned in the crabfish a seventeenth century english folk song it may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh frozen canned or powdered both the claws and the abdomen of h gammarus contain excellent white meat and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible the exceptions are the gastric mill and the sand vein gut the price of h gammarus is up to three times higher than that of h americanus and the european species is considered to have a better flavour
lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand in 2008 4 386 t of h gammarus were caught across europe and north africa of which 3 462 t 79 was caught in the british isles including the channel islands the minimum landing size for h gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm 3 4 in
aquaculture systems for h gammarus are under development and production rates are still very low
taxonomic history
homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by carl linnaeus in the tenth edition of his systema naturae published in 1758 that name was cancer gammarus since linnaeus concept of the genus cancer at that time included all large crustaceans
h gammarus is the type species of the genus homarus weber 1795 as determined by direction 51 of the international commission on zoological nomenclature prior to that direction confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names including astacus marinus fabricius 1775 and homarus vulgaris h milne edwards 1837 and also because friedrich weber s description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by mary rathbun rendering any prior assignments of type species for homarus h milne edwards 1837 invalid for homarus weber 1795
the type specimen of homarus gammarus was a lectotype selected by lipke holthuis in 1974 it came from 57 53 n 11 32 e near marstrand sweden 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of gothenburg but both it and the paralectotypes have since been lost
the common name for h gammarus preferred by the food and agriculture organization is european lobster but the species is also widely known as the common lobster

current designation
the current m 82 dates back to 1926 it ran from us 31 in hart to the northern junction of us 131 and m 46 in howard city the highway was routed through ferry hesperia and fremont replacing m 41 in late 1936 m 46 was extended along the section between newaygo and howard city forming a m 46 m 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the m 46 routing this concurrent section became just m 46 in 1938 shortening m 82 back to the northern m 37 junction in newaygo the highway was moved to a new alignment west of ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 instead of heading northwesterly to hart it was continued west to end in shelby

history
previously inhabited by the choctaw native americans the area now called meridian was obtained by the united states under the terms of the treaty of dancing rabbit creek in 1830 during the period of indian removal after the treaty was ratified european american settlers began to move into the area
after receiving a federal land grant of about 2 000 acres 810 ha richard mclemore the first settler of meridian began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area most of mclemore s land was bought in 1853 by lewis a ragsdale a lawyer from alabama john t ball a merchant from kemper county bought the remaining 80 acres 0 32 km2 ragsdale and ball now known as the founders of the city began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections
there was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name meridian believing the term to be synonymous with junction the more agrarian residents of the city preferred sowashee meaning mad river in a native american language from the name of a nearby creek and ragsdale proposed ragsdale city ball erected a station house on the mobile and ohio railroad the sign on which would alternate between meridian and sowashee each day eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left meridian on the station permanently the town was officially incorporated as meridian on february 10 1860
meridian was a small village at the start of the american civil war in 1861 its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the confederate construction of several military installations to support the war during the battle of meridian in 1864 general william tecumseh sherman led troops into the city destroying the railroads in every direction as well as an arsenal and immense storehouses his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground sherman is reported to have said afterwards meridian with its depots store houses arsenal hospitals offices hotels and cantonments no longer exists despite the destruction the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired back in operation 26 working days after the battle race relations remained tense during the reconstruction era with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses
the town boomed in the aftermath of the civil war and experienced its golden age from 1880 to 1910 the railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries which caused a population boom as the population rose commercial activity increased in the downtown area between 1890 and 1930 meridian was the largest city in mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the south many of the city s historic buildings were built during and just after this era including the grand opera house in 1890 the wechsler school in 1894 two carnegie libraries in 1913 and the threefoot building meridian s tallest skyscraper in 1929
the city continued to grow thanks to a commission government s efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following great depression the city continued to attract new businesses with escapism becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the depression the s h kress co building built to provide luxury to the common man opened in downtown meridian as did the temple theater which was used as a movie house the federal courthouse was built in 1933 as a wpa project
after a brief slowdown of the economy at the end of the depression the country entered world war ii which renewed the importance of railroads the rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles so meridian became the region s rail center again this renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s when the automobile and interstate highway system became more popular than passenger rails the decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas
during the american civil rights movement in the 1960s meridian was home to a council of federated organizations cofo office and several other activist organizations james chaney and other local residents along with michael schwerner his wife rita and andrew goodman volunteers from the north worked to create a community center holding classes to help prepare african americans in the area to regain the power to vote whites in the area resented the activism and racial tension often resulted in violence in june 1964 chaney schwerner and goodman went to neshoba county mississippi to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned the three disappeared that night on their way back to meridian following a massive fbi investigation their murdered bodies were found two months later buried in an earthen dam
seven klansmen including a deputy sheriff were convicted in the federal courthouse in meridian of depriving the victims of their civil rights and three were acquitted in the mississippi civil rights workers murders trial it was the first time that a white jury had convicted a white official in a civil rights killing in 2005 the case was reopened by the state which brought charges in the case for the first time edgar ray killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison meridian later honored chaney by renaming a portion of 49th avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service
starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north after strip commercial interests began to move downtown the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city the meridian historic districts and landmarks commission was created in 1979 and the meridian main street program was founded in 1985
meridian main street organized several projects to revitalize downtown including the construction of a new amtrak station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during meridian s golden age it had been demolished other projects included the renovation of the rosenbaum building in 2001 and weidmann s restaurant in 2002 as well as support for integrated urban design meridian main street along with the riley foundation helped renovate and adapt the historic grand opera house in 2006 for use as the mississippi state university riley center for education and the performing arts
after ownership of the meridian main street was transferred to the alliance for downtown meridian in late 2007 the two organizations along with the meridian downtown association spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort the alliance serves as an umbrella organization allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing and in turn the alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations plans were underway to renovate the threefoot building but newly elected mayor cheri barry killed the plans in early 2010 today the alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops restaurants and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night the meridian downtown association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events and the meridian main street program supports existing businesses downtown
hotels
given meridian s site as a railroad junction its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels even before meridian reached its golden age several large hotels including the great southern and the grand avenue hotels were built before the start of the 20th century with the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original union station in 1906 many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers the elmira hotel was constructed in 1905 and the terminal hotel was constructed in 1910 hotel meridian was constructed in 1907 and union hotel was built in 1908 union hotel was listed on the national register of historic places in 1979 and both hotel meridian and grand avenue hotel were listed as contributing properties to the meridian urban center historic district
as the city grew the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy as evidenced by the eleven story skyscraper lamar hotel built in 1927 listed on the national register of historic places in 1979 the lamar hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building in 1988 it was listed as a mississippi landmark
the e f young hotel was built in 1931 a staple in the african american business district that developed west of the city s core the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling african american could find a room
as the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and 70s most hotels moved outside of downtown rehabilitation of the riley center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel the threefoot building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations the threefoot preservation society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building s renovation featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events

papa stour
papa stour is one of the shetland islands in scotland with a population of under twenty people some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s located to the west of mainland shetland and with an area of 828 hectares 3 2 square miles papa stour is the eighth largest island in shetland erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves stacks arches blowholes and cliffs the island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife the west side of the island is a site of special scientific interest and the seas around the island are a special area of conservation
the island has several neolithic burial chamber sites as well as the remains of duke hakon s 13th century house dating from the norse occupation of the island the population reached 380 or more in the nineteenth century when a fishing station was opened at crabbaberry in west voe subsequently there was a steady decline in population although the numbers have increased from a low of 16 in the 1970s
today the main settlement on the island is biggings just to the east of which is housa voe from where the snolda ferry arrives from its base at west burrafirth on the shetland mainland crofting especially sheep rearing is the mainstay of island life
numerous shipwrecks have occurred around the coast and the celebrated poem da sang o da papa men by vagaland recalls the drama of the days when papa stour was a centre for deep sea fishing
geography
papa stour is located at the south western end of st magnus bay there are 34 kilometres 21 mi of rugged coastline which is indented by numerous small embayments and four larger voes hamna voe old norse harbour bay in the south is the most sheltered anchorage and the surrounding cliffs contain a natural rock arch housa voe to the east old norse house bay is less secluded but is the main harbour for the island and the ferry s embarkation point
brei holm and maiden stack guard the harbour entrance to the south the former is a tidal island and was a leper colony until the 18th century although it has been suggested that many of the lepers there were suffering from a vitamin deficiency rather than leprosy the latter s name relates to a story from the 14th century lord thorvald thoresson is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top whose ruins are still visible in order to preserve his daughter from men unfortunately for his plans when she left she was found to be pregnant in another version of the story she and her fisherman sweetheart successfully eloped west voe the inner part of which is called robies noust is the main voe in the north coast the smaller culla voe lying immediately to the west
the main settlement on the island today is biggings which overlooks housa voe and is surrounded by in bye land to the east of the hill dyke which runs south from west voe to the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till there is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile the lack of peat led to turf scalping for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior
the highest point on the island is in the north west at virda field which rises to 87 metres 285 feet virda is possibly from the old norse for heap of stones
list of outliers
in addition to the larger islets mentioned above there are various other isles and skerries around the coast of papa stour they include aesha stack boinna skerry borse skerry fogla skerry forewick holm galti stacks holm of melby koda skerry lyra skerry skerries of quidaness skerry of lambaness sula stack swat skerry the horn tiptans skerry and wilma skerry the ve skerries lie 5 kilometres 3 1 mi to the north west they include helliogoblo north skerry ormal reaverack and the clubb in between papa stour and ve skerries lies the shallow bank of papa rof
on 21 june 2008 stuart hill the owner and only resident of the 1 hectare 2 5 acres island of forewick holm which he has renamed forvik island made a declaration of dependence creating the crown dependency of forvik on the basis of a marriage arrangement between king christian of norway and king james iii of scotland that dates to 1468 hill argued that the island should be considered a british crown dependency and thus not a part of the united kingdom or of the european union this claim was not recognised by the united kingdom
geology
the island is composed of a variety of volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the devonian period at that time the scottish landmass formed part of the old red sandstone continent and lay some 10 25 degrees south of the equator the accumulations of old red sandstone laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago were created as earlier silurian rocks uplifted by the formation of pangaea eroded and then were deposited into river deltas the freshwater lake orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains stretching from shetland to the southern moray firth the structure of papa stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava rhyolite but there is also a devonian fish bed at lamba banks there are numerous large boulders deposited by pleistocene glaciation
erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves stacks arches blowholes cliffs voes and geos that are amongst the finest in britain the holl o boardie is a cave that passes right through the north west tip of the island it is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through kirstan or christie s hole in the south west is another spectacular cave part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981 yet another is francie s hole close to hamna voe in the west this was the favourite of john tudor who wrote of the island in his victorian memoirs and described the cave as
in fairyland so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so pellucid is the water with alcoves or recesses like stalls in a church
in 1953 the spectacular headland da horn o papa fell into the sea during a storm the nearby islet of brei holm also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit
ecology
otters grey seals killer whales and harbour porpoises are frequently seen on and around papa stour atlantic puffin arctic and common tern bonxie and arctic skua northern fulmar common guillemot razorbill curlew wheatear ringed plover and great black backed gull all breed on the island and numerous migratory species have been recorded
there is a profusion of wild flowers including mountain everlasting spring squill and eyebright as well as the ubiquitous heather the west side of the island is a site of special scientific interest and the seas around papa stour are a special area of conservation the traditional shetland pony is still bred
history and archaeology
human settlement of the island dates from circa 3000 bc and there are remains of several neolithic burial chambers known as heel shaped cairns little is known of the pre celtic and celtic eras but when the norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from papey st ra meaning big island of the papar celtic monks in distinction to papa little some 12 kilometres 7 5 mi to the west
norse period
papa stour is the subject of a 1299 manuscript written in old norse which is the oldest surviving document from shetland it deals with a dramatic incident in the house of duke hakon magnusson who was later to become king hakon v of norway there is a circle of stones near the beach at housa voe which are the remains of a ting or local assembly this was the scene of a duel fought and won by lord thorvald thoresson who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called dominus de papay the story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above the remains of duke hakon s thirteenth century house are still visible near housa voe
scots rule and fishing
in 1469 shetland came under nominal scottish control although the norse lairds of norway kept their papa stour estates until the 17th century in the 16th century merchants from bremen and hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet by the 18th century two scottish lairds thomas gifford of busta and arthur nicolson of lerwick owned the island they maintained a prosperous haaf old norse deep sea fishing industry undertaken in the summer months using six oared boats known as sixareens
in addition to the leper colony on brei holm there may have been another at hilla fielle overlooking hamna voe a recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony
the island church which overlooks kirk sand in the bay of fore wick was founded in 1806 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of sneeans or sn yans on the headland between the west end of kirk sand and the bay of tusselby it is called the ald kirk by locals and referred to by the ordnance survey as the site of a romish chapel belonging to about the twelfth century there is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day s work on the building was destroyed during the night eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re commenced there successfully excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it
in the 19th century the crabbaberry fishing station in west voe was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more however fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on at this time another duel entered the history of papa stour edwin lindsay an indian army officer and the son of the 6th earl of balcarres was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one he spent 26 years as a prisoner before the quaker preacher catherine watson arranged for his release in 1835 lindsay s well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe
there are good examples of horizontal water mills also known as norse or clack mills around dutch loch originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill stone was sited inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below some were still in use on papa stour in the early years of the 20th century and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the burn of clumlie at troswick in the south mainland of shetland
20th and 21st centuries
in common with many small scottish islands papa stour s population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then see e g mingulay by 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen fairly elderly residents but an advertisement in exchange and mart reversed the decline a croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants by 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 however by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases a number of people left the island and the school closed by early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left the 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 during the decade 2011 11 scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 to 103 702
overview of population trends
shipwrecks
the coasts around papa stour have claimed numerous wrecks in hamnavoe tiptans skerry alone has sunk dutch french german and norwegian ships
the aberdeen trawler ben doran a178 foundered on the ve skerries 3 miles northwest of papa stour on the evening of 28 march 1930 while on her way to the village of scalloway to land her catch when she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw and reported the wreck by the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers there being no lifeboat in shetland at that time weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries a request had been made for the stromness lifeboat from orkney only 120 miles away to launch but the request was made too late to be of help all 9 crew perished in the wreck only 3 bodies were recovered that of james mitchell which was returned to aberdeen and the bodies of j cormack and j r insh which were buried in scalloway
the cargo ship ss highcliffe ran aground in fog on forewick holm in february 1940 on this occasion the conditions were clement and only the ship and cargo were lost in 1967 the aberdeen trawler juniper ran aground in lyra sound at the bottom of the 60 metres 200 feet cliffs the 12 man crew were rescued by the aith lifeboat the coxswain being awarded the rnli silver medal for this rescue
papa stour s most recent shipwreck occurred on 9 december 1977 when the aberdeen trawler elinor viking a278 skipper alec flett foundered on the ve skerries the aith lifeboat came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions at the request of alec webster coastguard station officer lerwick a volunteer crew in a british airways sikorsky s61n helicopter from sumburgh airport was scrambled they managed to winch all the boat s crew to safety within hours of the grounding despite the storm force winds the helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery there was no loss of life but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979 and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present search and rescue helicopter unit based at sumburgh airport
economy transport
crofting is the mainstay of island life sheep form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept including cattle pigs goats chickens ducks and geese vegetable are grown too often in the shelter of circular walls such plots being known as plantie scrubs fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale there is a post office at the pier but no shop mains electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century the papa stour project is a christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues ferries now sail across the sound of papa to west burrafirth on the shetland mainland the crossing takes 45 minutes and although the snolda carries cars there is only one short road on the island for visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter but the strong tides in both the sound of papa and to the north west require considerable care
airstrip
there is an airstrip which caters for regular flights from tingwall
culture and the arts
the papa stour sword dance may be of norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of england a description of the dance appears in the pirate by sir walter scott
the writer and journalist john sands lived on papa stour and foula for a while during the late nineteenth century the writer folklorist and musician george p s peterson was brought up on papa stour
it is also the papa of vagaland s poem da sang o da papa men now adopted as part of the folksong tradition as set to music by t m y manson the insistent chorus chant rowin foula doon is particularly striking
oot bewast da horn o papa
rowin foula doon
owir a hidden piece o water
rowin foula doon
roond da boat da tide lumps makkin
sunlicht trowe da cloods is brakkin
we maan geng whaar fish is takkin
rowin foula doon
rowin foula doon refers to the fishermens practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of foula were no longer visible this entailed the boat being some 96 kilometres 60 mi west of papa stour the tide lumps are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide the resonant final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to papa by the scent o flooers across the water this is an example of vagaland s ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation an extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that da horn o papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem s composition so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life but a noted geographical feature
angel of death slayer song
angel of death is the opening track on the american thrash metal band slayer s 1986 album reign in blood the lyrics and music were written by slayer guitarist jeff hanneman and are based on nazi physician josef mengele who conducted human experiments at the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii angel of death led to the band facing accusations of nazi sympathizing and racism throughout their career
despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of reign in blood angel of death is featured on all of slayer s live albums and dvds and has appeared in several movies the song was well received by critics steve huey of allmusic described it as a classic
composition and origins
slayer guitarist jeff hanneman wrote angel of death after reading books about nazi physician josef mengele while on tour with the band i remember stopping someplace where i bought two books on mengele i thought this has gotta be some sick shit so when it came time to do the record that stuff was still in my head that s where the lyrics to angel of death came from
the lyrics detail mengele s surgical experiments on patients at the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii mengele s explorations were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins and included both physical and psychological examinations among the tests he performed that are mentioned in angel of death are experimental surgeries performed without anesthesia transfusion of blood between twins isolation endurance gassing injections with lethal germs sex change operations the removal of organs and limbs and abacination
sewn together joining heads just a matter of time til you rip yourselves apart a line from the penultimate verse is a reference to the allegation mengele stitched together twins one of them deformed the hunchback was sewn to the other child back to back their wrists back to back too this claim was first made by auschwitz survivor vera alexander at the 1961 trial of ss hauptscharf hrer adolf eichmann the architect of the holocaust where it was asserted that mengele sewed the veins together and turned them into siamese twins this allegation became more widely known when vera alexander was featured in the 1985 documentary the search for mengele which has been cited by several authors including gerald posner an expert on mengele
towards the end of the song there is a line feeding off the screams of the mutants he s creating which was taken from the film the boys from brazil in which dr mengele was the villain
controversy
the lyrical content of angel of death contributed to the delay of the release of slayer s 1986 album reign in blood the band were signed to def jam records whose distributor columbia records refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns deeming the artwork too graphic reign in blood was eventually distributed by geffen records on october 7 1986 however due to the controversy reign in blood did not appear on geffen records official release schedule
angel of death caused outrage among survivors of the holocaust as well as their families and the general public the controversy led to accusations of nazi sympathizing which have followed slayer throughout their career people took hanneman s interest in nazi history and his collection of nazi medals as evidence of sympathizing his most prized item being a german knight s cross hanneman counteracted asserting
i know why people misinterpret it it s because they get this knee jerk reaction to it when they read the lyrics there s nothing i put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man because to me well isn t that obvious i shouldn t have to tell you that
according to guitarist kerry king yeah slayer are nazis fascists communists all that fun shit and of course we got the most flak for it in germany i was always like read the lyrics and tell me what s offensive about it can you see it as a documentary or do you think slayer s preaching fucking world war ii people get this thought in their heads especially in europe and you ll never talk them out of it
the song drew accusations of racism which the band has denied the band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews and have stated numerous times that they do not condone racism and are merely interested in the subject
in 2006 the song jihad from slayer s 2006 album christ illusion drew comparison to angel of death jihad deals with the september 11 2001 attacks and tells the story from a terrorist s perspective vocalist araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of angel of death although it did not materialise in part he believes due to peoples view that the song is just slayer being slayer
music and structure
angel of death is the longest track on the album reign in blood spanning 4 minutes and 51 seconds where the total duration of the album is 29 minutes additionally it has one of the most conventional song structures on the album featuring prominent verses and choruses where most tracks on the album eschew them hanneman and king deliver their intricate riffs which offer the few hints of melody on the album according to popmatters reviewer adrien begrand and araya bursts out his piercing scream with lombardo performing beats of 210 beats per minute
when drummer lombardo left slayer in 1992 the band hired a full time replacement in forbidden drummer paul bostaph bostaph made one mistake out of the nine songs the band trialled him with on angel of death before the big double bass part there is a lead section which bostaph could not understand as he had to learn from live records recorded with lombardo bostaph could not tell how many revolutions the guitar riff goes before the bass sequence the band members told him there were eight perfecting the song afterwards
reception
although angel of death did not enter any charts it received strong praise from critics in reviews for reign in blood clay jarvas of stylus magazine noted that the song smokes the asses of any band playing fast and or heavy today lyrically outlining the horrors to come while musically laying the groundwork for the rest of the record fast lean and filthy
adrien begrand of popmatters remarked that there s no better song to kick things off than the masterful angel of death one of the most monumental songs in metal history where guitarists kerry king and jeff hanneman deliver their intricate riffs drummer dave lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded and bassist vocalist tom araya screams and snarls his tale of nazi war criminal josef mengele
capitalizing on the publicity generated by the controversy the band utilized nazi imagery by adapting a logo to one similar to the eagle atop swastika during the seasons in the abyss period hanneman placed ss stickers on his guitar and wrote ss 3 a song about reinhard heydrich the second in command in the schutzstaffel organization
appearances
angel of death has appeared in several movies and tv shows including gremlins 2 the new batch in a scene when the gremlin mohawk is turning into a spider jackass the movie during a car stunt the 2005 iraq war documentary soundtrack to war which details the role of music on the contemporary battlefield and on an episode of the leftovers when nora asks a female escort to shoot her
the half time riff was sampled by public enemy in their 1988 song she watch channel zero sampled by m o p in their song raise hell which appeared in the breaking bad episode thirty eight snub and sampled by kmfdm on their 1990 single godlike and featured in the multi platform video game tony hawk s project 8 nolan nelson who selected the soundtrack for the game asserts the song is one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever recorded don t know who slayer is i feel sorry for you
a slayer tribute band called dead skin mask released an album with eight slayer tracks angel of death being one of them the death metal bands debauchery and monstrosity covered the song and the track was featured on cello metal band apocalyptica s 2006 album amplified a decade of reinventing the cello sgt discharge a thrash metal band with members from morbid saint has also covered this song al sur del abismo tributo argentino a slayer a slayer tribute album compiled by hurling metal records featured sixteen tracks covered by argentina metal bands asinesia covered angel of death the song was once again covered by deathcore band carnifex and appears on their third album hell chose me as a bonus track included on the vinyl and itunes editions

meteorological history
on june 16 2011 a trough situated off the southern coast of guatemala showed signs of possible tropical cyclogenesis though located within an area favoring development the system remained broad and disorganized as it moved slowly west northwestward gradually convection consolidated around an area of low pressure on june 18 a tropical cyclone formation alert was issued for the system as it was expected to develop into a tropical depression within 24 hours on the following day the low further developed and was declared tropical depression two e by the national hurricane center at 1500 utc upon being declared the depression was located about 335 mi 540 km south southeast of l zaro c rdenas mexico however after post analysis the depression had actually developed nine hours earlier maintaining a west northwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge to the north the depression was forecast to move into a favorable environment characterized by low wind shear and sea surface temperatures up to 86 f 30 c three hours after classification the depression strengthened tropical storm beatriz the second named storm of the season
early on june 20 convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops denoted by cloud top temperatures below 80 c 112 f appearing on satellite imagery a notable increase in southerly outflow also took place as the subtropical ridge north of the storm weakened beatriz acquired a more northerly component to its track bringing the center of the storm closer to mexico convective bands gradually wrapped around the system throughout the day during the afternoon hours of june 20 a hurricane hunter aircraft found beatriz just below hurricane strength and subsequently the system was upgraded just a few hours later while situated roughly 85 mi 140 km southeast of manzanillo mexico early on june 21 a 23 to 29 mi 37 to 47 km wide eye developed within the central dense overcast in light of this the national hurricane center estimated beatriz to have attained winds of 90 mph 150 km h along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar hpa 28 85 inhg however it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105 mph 165 km h from the university of wisconsin and the satellite analysis branch
throughout the morning of june 21 beatriz brushed the coast of mexico with the center passing roughly 15 mi 20 km south southeast of la fortuna mexico centered just off the coast of mexico the system interacted with land and began weakening hours later convection rapidly diminished as dry air became entrained in the circulation in response to quick degradation of the system s structure the nhc downgraded beatriz to a tropical storm rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours the storm no longer had a defined circulation lacking an organized center and deep convection the final advisory was issued on beatriz the storm s remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly 175 mi 280 km southwest of cabo corrientes mexico
preparations and impact
following the classification of tropical depression two e on june 19 the government of mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas between zihuatanejo and manzanillo a hurricane watch was also put in place from tecp n de galeana to punta san telmo later that day the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the watch was extended westward to la fortuna as beatriz continued to strengthen the watches and warnings were extended westward to cabo corrientes on june 20 early on june 21 the easternmost advisories were discontinued as beatriz moved away later that morning all watches and warnings were discontinued in light of beatriz s rapid weakening
in colima and jalisco residents were warned of heavy rains that could trigger flooding and mudslides schools across both states canceled classes for june 21 in colima 236 shelters were opened to the public additionally the mexican navy was placed on standby for hurricane relief a total of 980 temporary shelters were opened in guerrero many of which were in acapulco as many residents were expected to evacuate flood prone area an orange level alert was issued for portions of chiapas in light of potentially heavy rains throughout western and southwestern mexico the servicio meteorol gico nacional national weather service advised that all air and sea traffic be suspended until the passage of beatriz
across guerrero beatriz produced heavy rain peaking at 222 5 mm 8 76 in in copala guerrero several homes across the state were damaged though none were destroyed in acapulco 380 homes were inundated by flood waters prompting evacuations in areas built in 1999 to relocate residents after hurricane pauline several landslides blocked off roads and a 100 m 330 ft section of a roundabout was destroyed in the community of amatillo three people were killed after being washed away by flood waters heavy rains from beatriz caused the sabana river to overflow its banks placing 150 homes across 14 colonias under water one person drowned in san agust n after falling in the swollen river twenty seven colonias in and around the city lost power after muddy floodwaters entered a substation throughout oaxaca at least a dozen homes lost their roofs due to high winds portions of colima chiapas michoac n and jalisco experienced heavy rains however in many areas the rain proved beneficial in mitigating a severe drought
the bourgeois blues
the bourgeois blues is a blues song by american folk and blues musician lead belly it was written in june 1937 in response to the discrimination and segregation that lead belly faced during a visit to washington dc to record for alan lomax it rails against racism the jim crow laws and the conditions of contemporary african americans in the southern united states
the song was recorded in december 1938 for the library of congress and re recorded in 1939 for commercial release it has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including pete seeger ry cooder hans theessink and billy bragg
the bourgeois blues is regarded as one of lead belly s best original works but it also drew controversy there is doubt over the song s authorship with some scholars contending that lead belly was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator questions have been raised over his role in the american communist party and whether he and the song were used to further the party s political goals
background and creation
most music historians date the writing of the bourgeois blues to lead belly s june 1937 trip to washington dc when he was invited by the folklorist alan lomax to record for the library of congress s folk music collection on the first night lead belly and his wife martha spent in the city they encountered racially discriminatory jim crow laws similar to those found in their native louisiana most hotels refused to rent rooms to african americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man lomax lomax in some versions of the story described as an unnamed white friend offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the supreme court building the next morning lead belly awoke to lomax arguing with his landlord about the presence of a black man with the landlord threatening to call the police
while in washington lead belly encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the impetus of the song for instance when lead belly lomax and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them lead belly was told that if he returned later without lomax he would be served
in response to one of these incidents a friend of lead belly s variously identified as either lomax or mary elizabeth barnicle joked that washington was a bourgeois town though lead belly did not know what the word bourgeois meant he was fascinated by the sound of it and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip the song came together quickly one account claims that it only took a few hours for lead belly to write it lomax liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment
lyrics themes and music
the bourgeois blues is a blues style protest song that criticizes the culture of washington dc it protests against both the city s jim crow laws and the racism of its white population its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to spread the news all around about the racial issues plaguing the city the song particularly in the refrain conflates race and economics by referring to caucasians as bourgeois
the first two verses speak of the segregation that lead belly encountered in washington dc the first recounts the fact that during the trip lead belly was turned down wherever he tried to get served due to his race while the second recounts the argument between lomax and his landlord over lead belly staying in his apartment the third verse sarcastically cites the home of the brave the land of the free juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in washington dc the fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city leading to the song s end which suggests that african americans boycott buying homes in the district
the song s tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters despite this by spreading the news of his poor treatment in a song the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern african americans and northern whites that the status quo is deeply flawed and that something needs to change
the bourgeois blues follows a traditional twelve bar blues format it is written in 44 time but annotated to note that the song rhythmically should swing at medium shuffle the song was written in b it uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating followed by the final two verses and a coda
recordings and adaptions
lead belly first recorded the bourgeois blues in december 1938 in new york city for donation to the library of congress he re recorded the song in april 1939 for musicraft records for release the same year as a 78 rpm record the version that was commercially released features lead belly singing and playing the twelve string guitar without any other accompaniment
the song has been covered and reinterpreted by a variety of artists including pete seeger and hans theessink seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums in australia the song was reworked as canberra blues by the bitter lemons an r b band the lyrics speak of the problems faced by young australians in the australian capital territory in the 1960s theessink adapted the song to his style of european blues for the album journey on in 1997
in 2006 billy bragg reworked the song as bush war blues bragg s cover is a topical protest song about the iraq war in one verse bragg claims that the iraq war was not for democracy but instead was to make the world safe for halliburton in another he takes on the christian right asking where the moderates are finally bragg chides the united states government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war
legacy
the bourgeois blues is one of lead belly s most famous songs and is remembered as his most heartfelt protest song there is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance robert springer claims that the song is peripheral to the wider study of the blues while lawson points to it as a watershed in the way african americans see themselves in the fabric of the united states there is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics after its release it became popular with left wing political groups lead belly was invited to perform at camp unity the communist party usa s summer retreat and the fbi subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s this led to the accusations that the communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform the party claims to the contrary that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform
jeff todd titon and several other writers have suggested that lead belly had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song this theory stems from the idea that lead belly did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by lomax since the music that lomax recorded was sold to northerners sympathetic to civil rights it has been suggested that lomax helped him write a song attractive to a white audience lead belly admitted that the term bourgeois was unfamiliar to him and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work

background and composition
sorry was one of the first tracks developed for confessions on a dance floor along with hung up and future lovers it was also the one which took the most time to finish because madonna thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right the songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind madonna commented that whenever i make records i often like the remixes better than the original ones so i thought screw that i m going to start from that perspective she promoted the album at the dance party misshapes held at luke leroy s nightclub in greenwich village invited by junior sanchez to take over the dj booth where she mixed hung up with sorry musically sorry is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus it is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of 132 beats per minute composed in the key of c minor madonna s vocal range spans from f3 to g4 it follows the chord progression of e cm a b during the spoken introduction it then changes to fm gm cm in the chorus while continuing in a cm a fm in the intermediate verses ultimately ending in repeated lines of i ve heard it all before
lyrically the song has excerpts of different languages including french spanish italian dutch hebrew hindi polish and japanese the song talks about personal empowerment and self sufficiency denoting a shift in focus of madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like everybody 1982 vogue 1990 or music 2000 which was centered around the subject of music itself among the various remixes the pet shop boys remix incorporated whitney houston s i wanna dance with somebody who loves me with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction pet shop boys and madonna had always mutually admired each other from the time they wrote the song heart 1988 for madonna but never delivered it the remix had added lyrics sung by band member neil tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album disco four madonna s voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook a breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends

high five interchange
the high five interchange is one of the first five level stack interchanges built in dallas texas located at the junction of the lyndon b johnson freeway interstate 635 i 635 and the central expressway us highway 75 us 75 it replaces an antiquated partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the 1960s
the 261 million project was started in 2002 and completed in december 2005 it was designed by the hntb corporation and built by zachry construction corporation
the interchange is considered by popular mechanics to be one of the world s 18 strangest roadways because of its height as high as a 12 story building its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features in 2006 the american public works association named the high five interchange as public works projects of the year
description
the high five interchange north of downtown in dallas texas is a massive five level freeway interchange it is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic the lyndon b johnson freeway interstate 635 and the central expressway us 75 and is the first five level stack interchange to be built in the city
it replaces the antiquated three level modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing us 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways the looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically backing up traffic left hand exits contributed to the congestion further its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other making local access difficult
alluding to the celebratory gesture the high five name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left turn movements that tower over the landscape the interchange is as high as a 12 story building and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels the high five 710 support tiers and 60 miles of additional highway the highest ramps are 120 feet 37 m above ground the lanes of us 75 which are on the bottom level are 20 feet 6 m below ground level giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top as part of the project i 635 was widened to include four dedicated high occupancy vehicle lanes hov lanes that are barrier separated and reversible
the roads on the five levels are
level i us 75 an eight lane highway four lanes going each way
level ii the junction of the two six lane frontage roads each having three through lanes in each direction left turn lanes and turnarounds and easy access to us 75 and i 635
level iii i 635 ten regular lanes five going each way and four hov lanes two going each way separated by barriers
level iv and v direct connection ramps two levels eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf
the interchange with its decorative etchings on precast concrete elements along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the texas department of transportation txdot can be regarded as an enormous work of public art the high five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail named the cottonwood trail which runs under all levels of the interchange the section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the high five project by txdot
the interchange is considered by popular mechanics as one of the world s 18 strangest roadways calling it a labyrinth of lanes and a five level marvel of engineering because of its height the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features
history
the high five interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing antiquated interchange that accommodated 500 000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in dallas it was a collaborative project between the txdot affected motorists and property owners and the primary contractor zachry construction an essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible
reasons for upgrading the interchange in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion were to improve air quality safety and local access
zachry construction corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the 261 million contract by txdot the largest ever by that agency the construction contract for the high five interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts for example it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete s strength the first time txdot had ever done so and contained an early completion bonus a sliding scale of up to 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years also built into the construction contract was a provision that zachry was charged for lane rentals by txdot for time they closed down traffic lanes fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed the fees ranged from 50 to a high of 110 000 for rush hours in order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished
to save time and money innovative construction methods were employed the original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans used to direct connect roads to be made of steel but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction cast in place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans however zachry decided to use precast concrete segmental bridges rather than casting the bridge elements in place and used a unique machine designed and constructed by deal s r l of italy and costing about 1 million to move the pieces into place
during the construction 2 2 million cubic yards of earthwork was used 350 000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site and 300 000 square feet of retaining walls were built additionally 40 000 feet of drilled shafts and 75 000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed in addition to the construction of 43 permanent bridges six temporary bridges were built resulting in 2 3 million square feet of bridge deck
the project was designed by the hntb corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction which had begun in 2002 and was completed in december 2005 more than 13 months sooner than planned

tim richmond
tim richmond june 7 1955 august 13 1989 was an american race car driver from ashland ohio he competed in indycar racing before transferring to nascar s winston cup series now sprint cup series richmond was one of the first drivers to change from open wheel racing to nascar stock cars full time which has since become an industry trend he won the 1980 indianapolis 500 rookie of the year award and had 13 victories during eight nascar seasons
richmond achieved his top nascar season in 1986 when he finished third in points he won seven races that season more than any other driver on the tour when he missed the season opening daytona 500 in february 1987 media reported that he had pneumonia the infection most likely resulted from his compromised immune system which was weakened by aids despite the state of his health richmond competed in eight races in 1987 winning two events and one pole position before his final race in august of that year he attempted a comeback in 1988 before nascar i banned him for testing positive for excessive otc over the counter drugs ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine nascar later announced they gave tim richmond a new test and tested negative tim richmond filed a lawsuit against nascar after nascar insisted they wanted access to his entire medical record before they would reinstate him after losing the lawsuit richmond withdrew from racing nascar later stated their original test was a bad test
richmond grew up in a wealthy family and lived a freewheeling lifestyle earning him the nickname hollywood in describing richmond s influence in racing charlotte motor speedway president humpy wheeler said we ve never had a race driver like tim in stock car racing he was almost a james dean like character when richmond was cast for a bit part in the 1983 movie stroker ace he fell right in with the group working on the film said director hal needham cole trickle the main character in the movie days of thunder played by tom cruise was loosely based on richmond and his interaction with harry hyde and rick hendrick
early life
richmond grew up in ashland ohio his parents al and evelyn n e warner richmond met in the course of their work al was a welder for pipe construction companies and evelyn was a field office manager noticing that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway to market this invention he founded richmond manufacturing which eventually exported machines worldwide
tim s driving days started as a toddler when he was given a go kart that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn he later raced the kart at tracks in moreland and new pittsburg richmond grew up in a well to do family and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates so his parents enrolled him in miami military academy in miami florida during his years in miami tim and his mother moved to florida and his father stayed in ohio while home in ohio over a summer break he met local drag racer raymond beadle through lifelong friend fred miller when richmond reached age 16 his parents purchased him a pontiac trans am a speedboat and a piper cherokee airplane for his birthday yet his mother evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son she once said tim was lazy and i did everything for him i ruined him i admit it he was my whole life
richmond excelled in sports he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron days were over miami military academy named him athlete of the year in 1970 richmond s other interests included flying and he earned his private pilot license at age 16 following high school graduation richmond attended ashland university for about one year before dropping out
racing career
open wheel racing
a friend of richmond s father co owned a sprint car and richmond joined the team as a crew member for dave shoemaker in 1976 21 year old richmond took the car onto lakeville speedway at lakeville ohio for some practice laps somebody put a stopwatch on me richmond said i was running laps faster than dave had been it was the first time i had ever driven a race car richmond and his father found a red white and blue colored no 98 car in pennsylvania which was the same number and paint scheme that richmond used on model cars as a child in his first competition at the track officials placed richmond in the slowest heat he passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight after being towed to the pits he parked the car for the rest of the event later that season they towed the car to eldora speedway only to have richmond crash the car again in response richmond s father fired him as the driver the next season al richmond bought a supermodified better suited to his son s driving style in 1977 tim richmond became both sandusky speedway s rookie of the year and the supermodified class track champion
richmond returned to racing sprint cars in the united states automobile club s usac national sprint car tour in 1978 competing in 12 races he finished 30th in points as the series rookie of the year that year he attended jim russell s road racing school at willow springs international motorsports park setting a student course record richmond raced in a 1978 mini indy car event at phoenix international raceway winning the formula super vee support event in a lola t620 the win attracted sponsors and attention from major owners like roger penske he also competed in usac s silver crown series
richmond s father bought an eagle indy car chassis and an offenhauser engine for the 1979 race at michigan international speedway richmond qualified 21st fastest with a 175 768 mph 282 871 km h lap significantly slower than bobby unser s 203 879 mph 328 111 km h pole position speed the race ended for him when his motor blew up on the fourth lap and he finished last 23rd owner pat santello was looking for a driver to replace larry rice for his cart team at the following race at watkins glen international so he gave richmond a test at willow spring where he had previously set the student record santello hired richmond who then qualified 15th fastest for the event and finished in eighth place the best of his indycar career richmond raced in three more events that season
after crashing during the first day of qualifying for the 1980 indianapolis 500 richmond nevertheless obtained the 19th starting position in the race he worked his way up to the top 10 during the race led a lap and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race to the delight of the crowd winner johnny rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits he was named the 1980 indianapolis 500 rookie of the year i busted up a few indy cars right after that he said milwaukee mid ohio at michigan i cut one in two i was afraid my racing career would come to a halt so when i got an offer to drive stock cars i took it and it turned out i liked driving them better
nascar
pocono raceway president joseph mattioli iii convinced richmond to make the change to stock car racing on the nascar circuit richmond made his first nascar start two months after winning the indianapolis 500 rookie of the year award he debuted at the coca cola 500 at pocono on july 27 1980 finishing 12th in a d k ulrich owned chevrolet that season he competed in five events with two dnfs did not finish and three 12th place finishes overall he finished the 1980 season 41st in points
richmond raced for three teams in 1981 he started the season by competing in 15 events for ulrich he had his first career top 10 finish taking sixth place at talladega superspeedway soon followed by a seventh place finish at texas world speedway after kennie childers hired him away from ulrich mid season richmond had top 10 finishes at pocono and bristol for the final seven races of the season he drove for bob rogers and had a top 10 finish at dover international speedway overall for the season richmond had six top 10 finishes to place 16th in season points
richmond started 1982 without a ride before getting a one race deal to drive for billie harvey at the rockingham track richmond completed 112 laps of the 492 lap event to finish 31st retiring from the race with engine problems for the following event richmond was hired to drive j d stacy s no 2 car in his first race for the team richmond earned his first career top 5 finish when he placed fifth at darlington raceway returning to pocono he finished second before winning his first race on the road course at riverside california the following week later that season he earned his first pole position at bristol the tour returned to riverside for the final race of the season where richmond won his second race sweeping both events at the track benny parsons said that watching richmond go through the esses was unbelievable for the season richmond had twelve top 10s two wins and one pole to finish 26th in points
in 1983 richmond began racing for raymond beadle whom he had known before he started racing he returned to the three cornered pocono racetrack earning his first oval victory during the season he accumulated four pole positions darlington pocono charlotte and atlanta one win pocono and fifteen top 10s on his way to finishing tenth in season points he made his first appearance in a nascar busch series now nationwide series car but did not finish any of the three races he entered that season
esquire magazine named richmond as one of the best of the new generation in 1984 that year he had one win at north wilkesboro speedway and second place finishes at dover darlington and riverside richmond finished the 1984 season 12th in points with 11 finishes in the top 10 and in six in the top 5 in 1985 the final season that richmond competed for beadle his best finish was a second place run at bristol he ended the season 11th in points with 13 top 10s in 28 races in the busch series he qualified at the pole position in the two races he entered and won the charlotte race
richmond joined hendrick motorsports in 1986 where he teamed up with veteran crew chief harry hyde it took the team until the middle of the season to gel richmond had suffered a 64 race winless streak that was finally broken at the van scoy diamond mine 500 at pocono in june 1986 after two straight second place finishes at charlotte and riverside richmond started the pocono event in third place inside the second row that race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point nascar wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track it took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields two hours later the track had dried and the race resumed with richmond in third after richmond s car was adjusted to remove the push the car was more to his liking because his radio did not work he was unable to communicate with his crew chief hyde and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left hyde worried that richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end after richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race dale earnhardt made up three seconds on richmond s five second lead with four laps to go buddy arrington spun in a three car accident the remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and richmond took the checkered flag for the victory he had led 97 laps including the final 30 taking his first victory in a rick hendrick car
the tour returned to pocono a month later and richmond battled for another victory in a fog shortened event in the final 8 lap sprint richmond competed in a three car battle with geoff bodine and ricky rudd richmond crossed the finish line beside rudd winning the race by 0 05 seconds he notched four more victories that season and over a span of twelve races richmond earned three second place finishes and six wins the national motorsports press association named him co driver of the year with earnhardt after richmond accumulated 13 top 5 finishes and 16 in the top 10 he had a career best third place finish in points after winning seven events in 1986 in what was his last full nascar season
illness and death
richmond fell ill the day after the 1986 nascar annual banquet during a promotional trip to new york he was not well enough to begin the 1987 nascar season despite lengthy hospitalization in cleveland and further rest at home when richmond missed the daytona 500 his condition was reported as double pneumonia media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids he returned to pocono for the miller high life 500 during the middle of the year starting third he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps including the final 46 to win the race by eight car lengths over bill elliott in the middle of the race richmond s car suffered gearbox problems because he could use only fourth high gear he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits richmond was emotional after the victory saying i had tears in my eyes when i took the checkered flag then every time anyone congratulated me i started bawling again richmond earned a victory in the next race at riverside and made his final 1987 start at michigan international speedway s champion spark plug 400 that august finishing 29th with a blown engine he resigned from hendrick motorsports in september 1987
although richmond attempted a comeback in 1988 nascar suspended him for testing positive for banned substances the substances were identified as sudafed a non prescription over the counter allergy medication and advil an over the counter pain reliever in april 1988 richmond sued nascar over the suspension although he retested later that year and was reinstated he could not find a car to drive in his final public appearance in february 1988 richmond denied that he abused drugs and said that a mistake had been made in his drug test his suit with nascar was settled out of court the terms sealed
richmond withdrew into his condo in florida there were by then rumors of hiv and aids which he denied he was later hospitalized in west palm beach
espn sent a get well soon card to richmond when it aired the july 1989 nascar race at pocono the television network showed highlights of richmond s victory at the track from 1986 tim had hollywood good looks and the charisma of tom cruise said his friend dr jerry punch there he was in victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging all over him it was important for the people at the hospital to see tim the way he really was when he was healthy and handsome and vital not the way he was as they saw him every day in the hospital
on august 13 1989 richmond died at the age of 34 about two years after his final nascar race he was buried in ashland ohio
the secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days at the time punch stated that richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident though it is unlikely that richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months ten days after his death on august 23 the richmond family held a press conference to reveal that richmond died from complications from aids which he acquired from an unknown woman richmond s physician dr david dodson said there s no way of knowing who that woman was tim was a celebrity with a lot of charisma a handsome guy he naturally attracted a lot of women punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent hiv testing in the wake of richmond s death
legacy
in 1990 a few months after richmond s death washington television station wjla tv and reporter roberta baskin reported that dr forest tennant who was then the national football league s drug adviser falsified drug tests that ultimately helped shorten richmond s nascar career baskin reported that sealed court documents and interviews showed tennant and nascar used allegedly false drug test results in 1988 to bar richmond from racing baskin also stated that nascar had targeted richmond requesting that tennant establish a substance abuse policy with richmond in mind a series of drug tests and falsely reported positive results shortly before the 1988 daytona 500 kept richmond from driving in what was to have been his last big race the report said the new york times published the findings while neither tennant nor nascar supplied an official response at the time nascar did confirm that they were seeking to replace tennant
the ashland county sports hall of fame inducted richmond in their second class in 1996 in 1998 nascar named richmond one of its 50 greatest drivers of all time he was inducted into the international motorsports hall of fame in 2002 the mansfield motorsports park arca re max series race in 2009 was named the tim richmond memorial arca re max 250 in honor of the area native the race at mansfield was co promoted by mattioli s son joseph mattioli iii
the documentary film tim richmond to the limit was produced as part of espn s 30 for 30 series with a premiere date of october 19 2010

trout creek mountains
the trout creek mountains are a remote semi arid great basin mountain range mostly in southeastern oregon and partially in northern nevada in the united states the range s highest point is orevada view benchmark 8 506 feet 2 593 m above sea level in nevada disaster peak elevation 7 781 feet 2 372 m is another prominent summit in the nevada portion of the mountains
the mountains are characteristic of the great basin s topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys oriented generally north to south the trout creek mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt which came from an ancient volcano and other vents on top of older metamorphic rocks the southern end of the range however features many granitic outcrops as a whole the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons
most of the range is public land administered by the federal bureau of land management there is very little human development in the remote region cattle grazing and ranching are the primary human uses but former mines at the mcdermitt caldera produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in north america in the 20th century public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited vegetation includes large swaths of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands sage grouse and mountain chickadee are two bird species native to the range and common mammals include pronghorn and jackrabbits
despite the area s dry climate a few year round streams provide habitat for the rare lahontan cutthroat trout fish populations in the trout creek mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century in the 1980s the effects of grazing allotments on riparian zones and the fish led to land use conflict the trout creek mountain working group was formed in 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners environmentalists government agencies and other interested parties the stakeholders met and agreed on changes to land use practices and since the early 1990s riparian zones have begun to recover
geography
the trout creek mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern oregon and northern nevada in harney and humboldt counties the nearest human settlements are the whitehorse ranch about 20 miles 32 km directly north from the middle of the mountains fields oregon about 23 miles 37 km to the northwest denio nevada about 15 miles 24 km to the west and mcdermitt nevada oregon about 30 miles 48 km to the east the mountains are about 150 miles 240 km directly southwest of boise idaho and about 190 miles 310 km northeast of reno nevada
the range and surrounding non mountainous areas cover an area of 811 square miles 2 100 km2 the mountains run 51 miles 82 km north to south and 36 miles 58 km east to west more of the range is in oregon 78 than in nevada 22 the highest point in the range is orevada view benchmark which is 8 506 feet 2 593 m above sea level and is located in nevada about one mile south of the oregon border about two miles southeast of orevada view is disaster peak a large symmetrical butte that is visible throughout the region at 7 781 feet 2 372 m disaster peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub range called the granites
the oregon canyon mountains border the trout creek mountains on the east along the harney malheur county line according to the united states geological survey s definitions while the pueblo mountains are the next range west of the trout creek mountains the bilk creek mountains in both oregon and nevada border the trout creek mountains on the southwest the two ranges are separated by log cabin creek and south fork cottonwood creek south of the trout creek mountains is the kings river valley which separates the bilk creek mountains on the west from the montana mountains on the east
the terrain in the trout creek mountains varies from broad flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock escarpments cut by deep canyons the canyons have steep walls with loose talus slopes at the bottoms there are meadows around springs in the mountains although most streams in the range do not flow year round major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include from west to east cottonwood creek trout creek willow creek and whitehorse creek these streams all flow into endorheic basins in harney county oregon trout creek and whitehorse creek are the largest of the four the kings river and mcdermitt creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the trout creek mountains the kings river begins in the granites and flows south into nevada where it meets the quinn river which evaporates in the black rock desert mcdermitt creek begins in oregon a few miles north of the granites and flows generally east crossing the oregon nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the quinn river valley south of mcdermitt
geology
the mountains lie within the basin and range province or great basin of the western united states which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north south mountain ranges separated by wide high desert valleys the trout creek mountains are uplifted and tilted blocks with steep escarpments along the southern and eastern sides of the range the southern area of the range known as the granites has numerous outcroppings of cretaceous age granite these granite outcrops are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic ridgelines
the trout creek mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where steens mountain is today crustal thinning and the yellowstone hotspot which was then beneath southeastern oregon induced eruptions from steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago in the miocene the vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the trout creek mountains eruptions from the steens volcano lasted for about one million years and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the triassic age formations of the blue mountains in northeastern oregon within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the cretaceous period
the broad mcdermitt caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the trout creek mountains the oval shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the oregon nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the oregon canyon mountains it is about 28 miles 45 km long and 22 miles 35 km wide the lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early miocene a total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure the caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago the caldera contains significant ore deposits and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony cesium and lithium
climate
the trout creek mountains are semi arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west when moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward over the oregon and california coastal ranges and the cascade range most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the trout creek mountains as a result the average annual precipitation in the trout creek mountains is only 8 to 26 inches 200 to 660 mm per year with most areas receiving between 8 and 12 inches 200 and 300 mm annually much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of march and the end of june most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months snowpack at elevations below 6 000 feet 1 800 m usually melts by april however at the higher elevations snow can remain until mid june local flooding often occurs in the spring as the snowpack melts
the prevailing winds are from the west southwest and they are normally strongest in march and april brief intense thunderstorms are common between april and october thunderstorms in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes
ecology
flora
vegetation in the trout creek mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses other common shrubs include bitterbrush snowberry and ceanothus there are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas common grass species include idaho fescue bluebunch wheatgrass cheatgrass western needlegrass sandberg s bluegrass thurber s needlegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail as well as basin wildrye in some well drained areas
less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian greenways vegetation along stream banks however these areas are vital to the local ecosystem the meadows surround springs which are mostly on gently sloping uplands or in stream bottoms and range in size from about 1 to 5 acres 0 40 to 2 02 ha narrow riparian greenways follow the year round streams many greenway areas have quaking aspen and willow groves cottonwood and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is flatter and stream channels are wider sedges and rushes are also native to these stream bottoms years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species riparian vegetation and young aspen and willow trees restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s however large wildfires in southeastern oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range s vegetation damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle
fauna
animals in the trout creek mountains are adapted to the environment of the high desert pronghorn are common in the open sagebrush covered basins while mule deer live in the cottonwood and willow groves there are also bighorn sheep cougars and bobcats in the high country jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they roam the great basin some other mammals include the northern pocket gopher mountain cottontail and belding s ground squirrel north american beavers live in and along streams as do pacific tree frogs western spadefoot toads and garter snakes native bird species include the sage grouse mountain chickadee gray headed junco black throated gray warbler virginia s warbler macgillivray s warbler pine siskin red crossbill bushtit hermit thrush northern goshawk and species of raven and eagle
several streams in the trout creek mountains are home to trout including the rare lahontan cutthroat trout subspecies these include willow creek whitehorse creek little whitehorse creek doolittle creek fifteen mile creek indian creek sage canyon creek line canyon creek and some tributaries of mcdermitt creek lahontan cutthroat trout live in small isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams many of them in the trout creek mountains these populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation for most of the 20th century the trout s numbers declined considerably it was listed under federal law as an endangered species in 1970 and was reclassified as threatened in 1975 reasons for the fish s decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing drought overfishing competition with other fish and hybridization with introduced rainbow trout which decreased the number of genetically pure lahontan cutthroat trout however reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zones since the 1980s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover
human uses
the bureau of land management blm administers most land in the trout creek mountains but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area the private lands are mainly used for ranching along mountain streams while the blm lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers cattle at least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892 some of which were staked for gold exploration commercial mining has occurred in some areas mostly near the mcdermitt caldera where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted mines in what was called the opalite mining district produced 270 000 flasks of mercury the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20th century the two leading mercury producing mines in north america were the cordero and mcdermitt mines on the edge of the caldera in nevada together they operated from 1933 to 1989 the mcdermitt mine the last mercury mine in the united states closed three years later in 1992 however mineral exploration has continued at the cordero mine in the 21st century and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of mcdermitt as part of a u s environmental protection agency cleanup project
the entire mountain range is very remote as a result there are few visitors and the range offers a wilderness like experience camping hunting fishing and hiking are the most popular activities the only developed recreation site nearby is at willow creek hot springs just south of the whitehorse ranch where nearby there are miles of trails designated for four wheel off road vehicles hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer pronghorn chukars and rabbits fishing on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch and release basis the mountains are also suitable for hiking cross country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek bottoms there are more than 100 archaeological sites in the range that document use by northern paiute people as long as 7 000 years ago
cattle grazing in the trout creek mountains began in the late 19th century and the blm currently oversees grazing allotments in the area cattle can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months the effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s
land management compromise
by the 1970s and 1980s a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the trout creek mountains and elsewhere in the great basin as a result stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones aspen populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures these conditions put the rare lahontan cutthroat trout population at risk since the lahontan was officially designated as a threatened species environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the trout creek mountains
beginning in the early 1970s the bureau of land management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas approximately 20 000 willow trees were planted along streams small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing next the agency sought to reform land use plans to change grazing practices which became a complex and controversial project
as environmentalists pressed the blm to close much of the trout creek mountains to grazing frustrated ranchers joined the sagebrush rebellion seeking to protect their grazing allotments initially it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades however in 1988 interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the trout creek mountain working group the group s goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone a plan that would protect both the land s ecological health and ranchers economic needs
initial members of the trout creek mountain working group included
over the next several years the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers meetings were all open to the public
the group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well being of ranchers in 1989 the whitehorse ranch agreed to rest two grazing allotments totaling 50 000 acres 20 000 ha to restore critical stream greenways and mountain pastures the ranch s allotment on fifteen mile creek was rested for three years and its willow creek pasture received a five year rest before grazing was resumed in addition the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two and the total number of cattle released in the allotment areas was reduced from 3 800 to 2 200 finally sensitive areas were fenced to protect them from cattle and additional water sources were constructed away from streams other ranches also agreed to rest specific pastures including the trout creek cottonwood creek and whitehorse butte allotments
in 1991 the bureau of land management approved a new grazing allotment management plan it was based on the agreements made by the trout creek mountain working group and it took effect in 1992 since then vegetation in riparian areas of the trout creek mountains has recovered and studies by the united states fish and wildlife service have found that the lahontan cutthroat trout population still listed as threatened is also recovering
mycena inclinata
mycena inclinata commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak stump bonnet cap is a species of mushroom in the family mycenaceae the doubtfully edible mushroom has a reddish brown bell shaped cap up to 4 5 cm 1 8 in in diameter the thin stem is up to 9 cm 3 5 in tall whitish to yellow brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish brown towards the base in maturity where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem the gills are pale brown to pinkish and the spore print is white it is a widespread saprobic fungus and has been found in europe north africa asia australasia and north america where it grows in small groups or tufts on fallen logs and stumps especially of oak british mycologist e j h corner has described two varieties of the mushroom from borneo lookalike species with which m inclinata may be confused include m galericulata and m maculata
taxonomy phylogeny and naming
first described as agaricus inclinatus by swedish mycologist elias magnus fries in 1838 it was assigned its current name in 1872 by lucien qu let mycena galericulata var calopus named by karsten in 1879 and its basionym agaricus galericulatus var calopus named by fries in 1873 are synonyms
in a molecular study of the large subunit ribosomal dna sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the orchid gastrodia confusa m inclinata was found to be closely related to m aurantiomarginata m crocata and m leaiana
the specific epithet inclinata means bent in the mushroom is commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak stump bonnet cap
description
the cap is light reddish brown with a diameter typically ranging from 1 to 4 5 cm 0 4 to 1 8 in initially conic to bell shaped to convex it flattens during maturity developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap the margin of the cap has minute but distinct scallops the surface is moist and smooth and hygrophanous the cap frequently develops splits in the margin or cracks in the disc the central part of the cap the flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere grayish to whitish fragile and with a slightly mealy odor and taste the gills have a decurrent attachment to the stem that is running down the length of the stem and are a pale brownish color with tinges of red they are broad between 3 and 6 mm and have a close to subdistant spacing with about 26 35 gills reaching the stem the fragile stem is 3 to 9 cm 1 2 to 3 5 in long by 0 15 to 0 4 cm 0 06 to 0 16 in thick and yellow to yellow brown becoming reddish brown to orange brown in the bottom half in maturity the lower portion of young stems is covered with white flecks roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem the edibility of the mushroom is doubtful and consumption best avoided

the spores are 7 9 by 5 6 5 m broadly ellipsoid smooth and strongly amyloid it turns black when treated with melzer s reagent the basidia spore bearing cells are four spored the pleurocystidia cystidia on the gill face are not differentiated the cheilocystidia cystidia on the gill edge are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous club shaped 26 36 by 5 10 m and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick the flesh of the gills is homogeneous and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine the flesh of the cap has a distinct pellicle a well differentiated hypoderm a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle and a filamentous tramal body gill tissue it is pale yellowish to sordid brownish in iodine stain
varieties
e j h corner defined the varieties m inclinata var kinabaluensis and var subglobospora in his 1994 publication on agaric mushrooms of malesia a biogeographical region straddling the boundary of the indomalaya and australasia ecozones the variety kinabaluensis named after its type locality kinabalu has a cap margin that is not scalloped little or no odor and cheilocystidia with shorter processes it was found growing on the dead wood of lithocarpus havilandii a stone oak tree in the beech family variety subglobospora found in sabah has spores that are almost spherical
similar species
mycena maculata bears some resemblance to m inclinata but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps and is found in eastern north america and sometimes on oak on the west coast in age it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in m inclinata m inclinata is often confused with the edible m galericulata a common species that is variable in cap color size and shape m galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray brown and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross veins m polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish gray
habitat and distribution
mycena inclinata is a saprobic fungus deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves twigs bark and branches it accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter cellulose hemicellulose and lignin
the fruit bodies of mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps especially oak and chestnut during the spring and autumn the fungus forms a white woolly mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves occasionally it can be found growing on a living tree in eastern north america it is abundant in the area bounded by nova scotia ontario manitoba missouri north carolina and new york it has been found in oregon but the species appears to be generally rare along the pacific coast the range of the fungus also includes europe the canary islands north africa east siberia japan malesia turkey and new zealand
chemistry
in a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in ordu turkey m inclinata was found to have comparatively high levels of iron 628 mg per kg and nickel 21 6 mg kg measured on a dry weight basis laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum the fungus has been investigated for its ability to decolorize synthetic dyes that are used in the textile plastics biomedical and foodstuff industries the dyes are not readily biodegradable and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic
capel lligwy
capel lligwy sometimes referred to as hen gapel lligwy is a ruined chapel near rhos lligwy in anglesey north wales dating back to the first half of the 12th century the chapel s original purpose is unknown but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population it was used for a time until the early 18th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house then later fell into disrepair the walls still remain with some traces of render on them internally but there is no roof
it contains a 16th century side chapel with a vault beneath used as a burial chamber it is a grade ii listed building a national designation given to buildings of special interest which warrant every effort being made to preserve them in particular because it is a substantially 12th century structure with the unusual 16th century vaulted south chapel
history and location
the oldest parts of capel lligwy date from the first half of the 12th century this was a time when many churches on anglesey in north west wales were first built in stone following the end of viking raids and attempts by the normans to gain control of the island the reason for its construction and the saint to whom it was dedicated are unknown geraint jones author of a 2006 guide to the churches of anglesey suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel or connected to a royal court nearby yates and longley authors of a 2001 guide to ancient anglesey monuments note that it was built in the large parish of penrhos lligwy and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times despite this it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right the chapel is sometimes referred to as hen gapel lligwy hen being the welsh word for old and capel meaning chapel
the walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century and the upper parts of the walls date from this time a chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century a vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family the pierce lloyds in 1999 the vault was used to record some atmospheres for the album you have just been poisoned by the serpents by the serpents a collective of welsh musicians including members of echo and the bunnymen super furry animals and ectogram that was described by one journalist as possibly the strangest pop group of all time
for a time capel lligwy was used as a private place of worship for lligwy house a venerable mansion once owned by the lloyd family which came into the possession of william irby 1st baron boston in the 18th century after the early part of the 18th century however the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair the walls remain to gable level with some traces of render on the inside but the roof has gone
capel lligwy is in the anglesey countryside near llanallgo the parish church of st gallgo llanallgo is about 0 78 miles 1 26 km away part of the churchyard wall remains showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure as often found with early churches it is cared for by cadw the welsh assembly government body responsible for the built heritage of wales and is open to the public
architecture and fittings
capel lligwy is built from rubble masonry at about 5 feet 1 5 m up the walls the style changes and smaller stones are inserted into spaces between the larger blocks showing where the 14th century rebuilding started the doorway is on the south side headed by a plain arch and dates from the 12th century there is a stone bellcote at the west end there is no structural division between the nave where the congregation would have sat and the chancel where the altar would have been located there are no window openings on the north side but there is a blocked opening to the east about 5 feet 1 5 m wide and there are the remains of a window on the south wall there is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel the vault which is about 27 square feet 2 5 m2 is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel limestone slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above a stone in the nave about 2 square feet 0 19 m2 with a hole in the top might once have been used as a churchyard cross
assessment
capel lligwy has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a grade ii listed building the lowest of the three grades of listing designating buildings of special interest which warrant every effort being made to preserve them it was given this status on 2 september 1952 and has been listed because it is important as a substantially 12th century structure with some architectural details surviving from this early period even though it is now in a ruinous condition cadw which is responsible for the inclusion of welsh buildings on the statutory lists also notes the unusual 16th century vaulted south chapel
the 19th century antiquarian angharad llwyd mentioned the church in her history of anglesey she said that the architecture was of the rudest kind which bears testimony to its great antiquity she recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins and when it was dug out the vault was discovered containing several human skeletons which crumbled into dust when exposed to the air she added that further exploration of the vault then revealed a large mass of human bones several feet in depth
a 1990 book about abandoned churches in wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of anglesey and calls capel lligwy a medieval gesture of christian power in a land so obviously imbued with the spirit of a pagan past it notes that the wheel has turned full circle and capel lligwy today is just another ruined relic of a former age the authors describe the chapel as a simple square building with a small and ruggedly austere south chapel adding that the stone slabs over the vault are almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape

team players drafted into the nba
upsilon andromedae b
upsilon andromedae b abbreviated andromedae b and b occasionally designated upsilon andromedae ab to distinguish it from the red dwarf upsilon andromedae b also named saffar is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light years away from the sun in the constellation of andromeda the planet orbits the solar twin star upsilon andromedae a approximately every five days discovered in june 1996 by geoffrey marcy and r paul butler it was one of the first hot jupiters to be discovered it is also one of the first non resolved planets to be detected directly upsilon andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system
in july 2014 the international astronomical union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars the process involved public nomination and voting for the new names in december 2015 the iau announced the winning name was saffar for this planet the winning name was submitted by the vega astronomy club of morocco and honours the 11th century astronomer ibn al saffar of muslim spain
discovery
like the majority of known extrasolar planets upsilon andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star s radial velocity caused by the planet s gravity the variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the doppler shift of upsilon andromedae s spectrum the planet s existence was announced in january 1997 together with 55 cancri b and the planet orbiting tau bo tis
like 51 pegasi b the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star upsilon andromedae b orbits very close to its star closer than mercury does to our sun the planet takes 4 617 days to complete an orbit with a semimajor axis of 0 0595 au
a limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect upsilon andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found in the case of upsilon andromedae b this lower limit is 68 7 of the mass of jupiter though depending on the inclination of the orbit the true mass may be much greater however astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around 25 and the true mass may be about 1 4 mj coplanarity is not to be assumed the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees
physical characteristics
given the planet s high mass it is likely that upsilon andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface
the spitzer space telescope measured the planet temperature and found that the difference between the two sides of upsilon andromedae b of about 1 400 degrees celsius ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1 400 to 1 650 degrees celsius the temperature difference has led to speculation that upsilon andromedae b is tidal locked with the same side always facing upsilon andromedae a
sudarsky had on the assumption that the planet is similar to jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium predicted upsilon andromedae b to have reflective clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere the cloud deck instead absorbs the sun s radiation between that and the hot high pressure gas surrounding the mantle exists a stratosphere of cooler gas the outer shell of dark opaque hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides pm planets but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet
the planet is unlikely to have large moons since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system
the planet with 51 pegasi b was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by planetpol preliminary results from polarimetric studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color is 1 36 times as large and 0 74 times as massive as jupiter meaning that the mean density is 0 36g cm3 it has a geometric albedo of 0 35 in visible light
effect on its sun
upsilon andromedae b appears to be responsible for increased chromospheric activity on its parent star observations suggest that there is a hot spot on the star around 169 away from the sub planetary point this may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star the mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of rs canum venaticorum variable stars or the interaction between jupiter and its moon io
daniel radcliffe
daniel jacob radcliffe born 23 july 1989 is an english actor who rose to prominence as the title character in the harry potter film series he made his acting debut at 10 years of age in bbc one s 1999 television film david copperfield followed by his cinematic debut in 2001 s the tailor of panama at age 11 he was cast as harry potter in the first harry potter film and starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the eighth and final film in 2011
radcliffe began to branch out to stage acting in 2007 starring in the london and new york productions of equus and in the 2011 broadway revival of the musical how to succeed in business without really trying he starred in the 2012 horror film the woman in black and played beat poet allen ginsberg in the 2013 independent film kill your darlings
he has contributed to many charities including demelza hospice care for children and the trevor project for suicide prevention among lgbtq youth which gave him its hero award in 2011
early life
radcliffe was born in west london england he is the only child of alan george radcliffe a literary agent and marcia jeannine gresham n e marcia gresham jacobson a casting agent who was involved in several films for the bbc including the inspector lynley mysteries and walk away and i stumble his father who was raised in banbridge county down northern ireland is from a very working class protestant background his mother is jewish and was born in south africa and raised in westcliff on sea essex her family had originally come from poland and russia radcliffe s parents had both acted as children
in a 2012 interview radcliffe stated there was never religious faith in the house i think of myself as being jewish and irish despite the fact that i m english he has stated we were christmas tree jews and that he is very proud of being jewish
radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at the age of five and in december 1999 aged 10 he made his acting debut in bbc one s televised two part adaptation of the charles dickens novel david copperfield portraying the title character as a young boy he was educated at two independent schools for boys sussex house school a day school in chelsea s cadogan square and the city of london school a day school on the north bank of the river thames in london s financial district known as the city of london attending school became difficult for radcliffe after the release of the first harry potter film with some fellow pupils becoming hostile though he says it was people just trying to have a crack at the kid that plays harry potter rather than jealousy
as his acting career began to consume his schedule radcliffe continued his education through on set tutors he admitted he was not very good at school considering it useless and finding the work really difficult he achieved a grades in the three as level exams that he took in 2006 but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience the paparazzi they d love it he told details magazine in 2007 if there were any parties going on they d be tipped off as to where they were
career
harry potter
in 2000 producer david heyman asked radcliffe to audition for the role of harry potter for the film adaptation of harry potter and the philosopher s stone the best selling book by british author j k rowling rowling had been searching for an unknown british actor to personify the character and the movie s director chris columbus recalled thinking this is what i want this is harry potter after he saw a video of the young actor in david copperfield eight months later and after several auditions radcliffe was selected to play the part rowling also endorsed the selection saying i don t think chris columbus could have found a better harry radcliffe s parents originally turned down the offer as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in los angeles warner bros instead offered radcliffe a two movie contract with shooting in the uk radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that
the release of harry potter and the philosopher s stone released as harry potter and the sorcerer s stone in the united states took place in 2001 radcliffe received a seven figure salary for the lead role but asserted that the fee was not that important to him his parents chose to invest the money for him the film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews and critics took notice of radcliffe radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader s imagination it is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing wrote bob graham of the san francisco chronicle
a year later radcliffe starred in harry potter and the chamber of secrets the second installment of the series reviewers were positive about the lead actors performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole the 2004 release harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was the third film in the series radcliffe s performance was panned by new york times journalist a o scott who wrote that watson had to carry him with her performance next was harry potter and the goblet of fire in 2005 the film was the second highest grossing harry potter film at that point and radcliffe singled out the humour as being a reason for the movie s creative success
the future of the franchise was put into question when radcliffe and his co leads emma watson and rupert grint hesitated signing on to continue their roles for the final two episodes however by march 2007 radcliffe had signed for the final films which put an end to weeks of press speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in equus in which he had performed nude on stage radcliffe reprised his role for the fourth time in harry potter and the order of the phoenix 2007 radcliffe stated that director david yates and actress imelda staunton made order of the phoenix the most fun film in the series to work on his performance earned several award nominations and he received the 2008 national movie award for best male performance as his fame and the series continued radcliffe grint and watson left imprints of their hands feet and wands in front of grauman s chinese theatre in hollywood in july 2009 harry potter and the half blood prince was released the series sixth instalment radcliffe received nominations for best male performance and global superstar at the 2010 mtv movie awards
for financial and scripting reasons the last book was divided into two films shot back to back which drew criticism from the series fanbase radcliffe defended the split stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film he added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast paced with a lot of action while the first part would be far more sedate focusing on character development he added that had they combined them those things would not have made it to the final cut filming lasted for a year concluding in june 2010 and on the last day of shooting like most of the cast and crew radcliffe openly wept
the final film harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 was released in july 2011 radcliffe along with the film was critically acclaimed ann hornaday of the washington post asked who could have predicted that radcliffe grint and watson would turn out to be good actors similarly rex reed said frankly i m sorry to see radcliffe go while rolling stone critic peter travers commented on radcliffe well played sir roger ebert gave the film a highly positive review but felt that radcliffe grint and watson were upstaged by the supporting actors
radcliffe admitted that some people would never be able to separate him from the character but also said he is proud to be associated with this film series forever despite positive feelings about the movies he has no interest in doing more harry potter films after rowling hinted about writing an eighth book radcliffe was asked if he would do another film to which he replied it is very doubtful i think 10 years is a long time to spend with one character despite devoting so much time to the series radcliffe has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors i ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing potter
2001 09
radcliffe made his film debut in the tailor of panama an american 2001 film based on john le carr s 1996 spy novel and a moderate commercial success in 2002 he made his stage debut as a celebrity guest in a west end theatre production of the play what i wrote directed by kenneth branagh who also appeared with him in the second harry potter film in 2007 he appeared in the film december boys an australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in 2005 and released to theatres in mid september 2007 also in 2007 radcliffe co starred with carey mulligan in my boy jack a television drama film shown on itv on remembrance day the film received mostly positive reviews with several critics praising radcliffe s performance as an 18 year old who goes missing in action during a battle radcliffe stated for many people my age the first world war is just a topic in a history book but i ve always been fascinated by the subject and think it s as relevant today as it ever was

the production continues and after the filming of a pool scene the crew gather in catering beeman discovers a severed finger in his sandwich recognizing from its ring that it belonged to niederman when the sheriff shuts down production black theorizes that the killer may target the crew s hotel he and hollis arrive to find the body of the film s publicist hanging from a rope the next day a film extra gene simmons confesses to the killings black pokes holes in his story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator regardless production is resumed and shortly afterwards several crew members are found with their throats cut while winston s body hangs nearby in an apparent murder suicide

production

the episode features guest appearances by the members of the band kiss peter criss ace frehley gene simmons and paul stanley who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role however the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue which led to perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and fax updated scripts to the shooting locations ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode ace frehley was also unenthusiastic towards his role and requested to play a 300 pound black man instead wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the 1996 eddie murphy film the nutty professor he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to fabricate
perry has described the production thirteen years later as being one of the most gruelling of the series run citing its abundance of stunt work and physical effects as the cause of this perry praised wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode guest star jeff yagher who played killer mark bianco is the husband of actress megan gallagher who starred in the first two seasons of millennium as black s wife catherine

history
the current route was originally legislated in 1911 as part of the delaware river drive a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the delaware river from trenton to the new york border in montague township route 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from trenton to newark the original route ran from downtown trenton along state street and sanhican drive from there it followed its current alignment to lambertville where it followed present day route 179 to ringoes to present day county route 514 which it followed to woods tavern the route turned north on u s route 206 also designated route 31 and followed that route to somerville where it followed u s route 22 to newark the current alignment of route 29 from lambertville to route 12 in frenchtown was designated route 29a in 1927
the alignment of route 29 between ringoes and somerville was eventually shifted to follow present day u s route 202 which was also route 30 now route 31 between ringoes and flemington and route 12 between flemington and somerville in 1938 route 29b was planned as an extension of route 29a from frenchtown to route 28 now route 122 in alpha while this road was never built much of the alignment north of milford is served by county route 519 in 1948 a spur route route s29 was created running along u s route 202 bridge street in lambertville to the new hope lambertville bridge in the 1953 new jersey state highway renumbering route 29 was redefined to continue north from lambertville to frenchtown on route 29a and the route 29 designation between lambertville and newark was removed in favor of u s route 202 between lambertville and somerville and u s route 22 between somerville and newark the section of former route 29 between route 29a and route s29 became route 165
plans for a limited access route along the route 29 corridor go back to 1932 when a parkway was proposed along the delaware river between trenton and lambertville this proposal never materialized plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road the john fitch parkway that was to run from hamilton township to interstate 95 in ewing township this road was built between 1954 and 1957 from south warren street in trenton to present day interstate 95 in ewing township construction of this portion john fitch parkway took up much of trenton s available waterfront along the delaware river the former alignment of route 29 in the northern part of trenton and in ewing township became route 175
between 1990 and 1995 the route 29 freeway was built between the interstate 195 interstate 295 interchange and route 129 in hamilton township a two lane street lamberton road connected the two freeway sections plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in trenton construction began in 1997 on the route 29 freeway between route 129 and the morrisville trenton railroad bridge the road was to include two traffic lights at cass street and south warren street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the delaware river the tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the army corps of engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel the roof was put in place in october 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on march 2 2002 a restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in november 2002
by the 2000s the state gave the part of route 29 south main street between route 165 and route 179 in lambertville to the city and route 29 was rerouted to use all of route 165 and one block of route 179 prior to this south main street had been turned one way southbound route 165 which is only signed on overhead street signs still exists though it is fully concurrent with route 29

first mongol invasion of burma
the first mongol invasions of burma myanmar burmese were a series of military conflicts between kublai khan s yuan dynasty division of the mongol empire and the pagan empire that took place between 1277 and 1287 the invasions toppled the 250 year old pagan empire and the mongol army seized pagan territories in present day dehong yunnan and northern burma to tagaung the invasions ushered in 250 years of political fragmentation in burma and the rise of tai shan states throughout mainland southeast asia
the mongols first demanded tribute from pagan in 1271 72 as part of their drive to encircle the song dynasty of china when king narathihapate refused emperor kublai khan himself sent another mission in 1273 again demanding tribute it too was rejected in 1275 the emperor ordered the yunnan government to secure the borderlands in order to block an escape path for the song and permitted a limited border war if pagan contested pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the mongol army in 1277 78 after a brief lull kublai khan in 1281 turned his attention to southeast asia demanding tribute from pagan the khmer empire i vi t and champa when the burmese king again refused the emperor ordered an invasion of northern burma two dry season campaigns 1283 85 later the mongols had occupied down to tagaung and hanlin forcing the burmese king to flee to lower burma the mongols organized northern burma as the province of zhengmian
ceasefire negotiations began in 1285 and ended with narathihapate finally agreeing to submit in june 1286 the burmese embassy received by the emperor in beijing in january 1287 agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the suzerainty of the yuan dynasty or the mongol empire over the pagan empire and annual payments in taxes to the yunnan government in exchange for the evacuation of mongol troops from northern burma but the treaty never really took effect as narathihapate was assassinated in july 1287 and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged the mongol command at yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void and ordered an invasion of central burma they may not have reached pagan and even if they did after having suffered heavy casualties they returned to tagaung
the pagan empire disintegrated and anarchy ensued the mongols who probably preferred the situation did nothing to restore order in the next ten years in march 1297 they accepted the voluntary submission of king kyawswa of pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of pagan bagan but kyawswa was overthrown nine months later and the mongols were forced to intervene leading to their second invasion in 1300 01
marco polo reported the first invasions 1277 87 in his travelogue il milione the burmese referred to the invaders as the taruk after the central asian turkic troops that largely made up the mongol invasion army today the term taruk refers to the han chinese instead king narathihapate is unkindly remembered in burmese history as taruk pye min the king who fled from the taruk
background
pagan and dali
in the 13th century the pagan empire along with the khmer empire was one of the two main empires in mainland southeast asia for much of its history pagan s neighbor to the northeast was not china but the independent dali kingdom and its predecessor nanzhao both with dali as their capital city dali based kingdoms were a power in their own right at times allying themselves with the tibetan empire to their west and at other times with china s tang and song dynasties indeed nanzhao s mounted armies ventured deep into what is today burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of pagan and the pagan dynasty itself
between the newly conquered mongol territory and pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present day dehong baoshan and lincang prefectures in yunnan as well as the wa and palaung regions presumably in present day northern shan state which pagan and dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence then as now the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges
mongol conquest of dali
the mongol empire first arrived at the doorstep of the pagan empire in 1252 by invading the dali kingdom in its attempt to outflank song china the mongol armies captured the capital dali on 7 january 1253 and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257
the arrival of the mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the mongols were intent on finishing off the song for the next dozen years they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from china to burma and india the mongols set up military garrisons manned mostly by turkic speaking muslims from central asia in 37 circuits of the former dali kingdom
decline of pagan
by then the pagan empire despite outward appearances of calm had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century the continuous growth of tax free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom the crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258 60 in south arakan and martaban mottama the decline continued on the eve of the mongol invasions between one and two thirds of upper burma s cultivable land had been donated to religion the crown s ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy
prelude to war
first mongol mission 1271 72
the period of calm for pagan ended in the early 1270s by then the song were on the ropes and emperor kublai khan who officially founded the yuan dynasty on 18 december 1271 sought to cut off the retreat of song refugees in all directions in pagan s case he had ordered the mongol governor of dali to tighten control of the borderlands and in january 1271 to send a mission to pagan to demand tribute the tribute he demanded was nominal given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at pagan at the border the ruler of the wa and palaung regions submitted to the mongols
when the mongol envoys led by qidai tuoyin showed up the pagan court led by chief minister ananda pyissi was well aware of the military power of the mongols and advised king narathihapate to use diplomacy the king was furious at the demand and kept the mongol envoys waiting for weeks the court finally devised a compromise the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king accompanying them was a burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the burmese king s wish to one day worship a buddha tooth at beijing the king then promptly ordered an expedition which retook the rebellious borderland regions in april 1272 the rebel leader a pi was brought back to pagan dali relayed the news to beijing but did not carry out any military action
second mongol mission 1273
at beijing kublai khan who was preparing an invasion of japan decided against a war with pagan for the time being on 3 march 1273 he sent a 4 member delegation led by an imperial ambassador the first secretary to the board rites to pagan the delegation carried a letter from the emperor the letter says
if you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the all highest send one of your brothers or senior ministers to show men that all the world is linked with us and enter into a perpetual alliance this will add to your reputation and be in your own interests for if it comes to war who will be the victor ponder well o king our words
this time the burmese king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit the burmese chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed but both burmese inscriptional evidence and yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed at any rate the imperial envoys did not get back to yunnan in due time the newly formed yunnan government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation but the delegation could not reach pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route
mongol consolidation of borderlands 1275 76
meanwhile in 1274 the former dali kingdom was officially reorganized as the province of yunnan with sayyid ajjal shams al din omar as governor in may 1275 the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned that the burmese evidently had no intention of submitting and that war was the only way forward
but the emperor rejected an outright invasion just coming off a disastrous japanese campaign the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair he was now focused on delivering the final blow against the song the emperor ordered the yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the song refugees he also sanctioned a limited border war if pagan contested the takeover as planned the yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275 76 elsewhere the main mongol armies had captured most of the song territory by 1276
by 1277 at least one burmese vassal state named gold teeth modern yingjiang had submitted to the mongols like in 1272 the burmese government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state but unlike in 1272 the mongols had posted a sizable garrison there though it was ultimately under mongol command many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were turkic speaking peoples or people from the further west turks from samarkand bukhara merv and nishapur but also captive soldiers from the persian khwarazmid empire the kipchaks and even bulgars from the lower volga
border war 1277 78
what followed was a border war in 1277 78 it was reported mainly in the yuan dynasty chronicle and the travelogue of marco polo although the burmese chronicles have no record of the border war a 1278 burmese inscription mentions the army s defeat at ngasaunggyan the mongol accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate
battle of ngasaunggyan
according to the yuan dynasty chronicle and marco polo s accounts a burmese army invaded the mongol territory of gold teeth and was defeated by the mongol army in april 1277 the battle took place either at the vochang valley in present day baoshan prefecture or 110 km southwest at kanngai present day yingjiang dehong prefecture which the burmese called ngasaunggyan
the yuan chronicle reports that only 700 men defeated a burmese army of 40 000 to 50 000 with 10 000 horses and 800 elephants it also reports only one mongol was killed in trying to catch an elephant according to marco polo the mongol army consisted of 12 000 mounted archers and the burmese army numbered 60 000 men with 2000 elephants on each of which was set a tower of timber well framed and strong and carrying from 12 to 16 well armed fighting men even then the 40 000 to 60 000 figures of the burmese army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high the mongols may have erred on the side of generosity not to diminish their glory in defeating superior numbers
according to marco polo s account in the early stages of the battle the turkish and mongol horsemen took such fright at the sight of the elephants that they would not be got to face the foe but always swerved and turned back while the burmese forces pressed on but the mongol commander huthukh did not panic he ordered his troops to dismount and from the cover of the nearby treeline aim their bows directly at the advancing elephants the mongol archers arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled
raid of kaungsin
the mongol army pressed on after the monsoon season in the following dry season of 1277 78 c december 1277 a mongol army of 3800 led by nasr al din son of gov sayyid ajjal advanced to kaungsin which defended the bhamo pass they occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned stockades but they found the heat excessive and returned
interlude 1278 83
despite the mongol military success the control of the borderlands remained contested pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions and the burmese apparently taking advantage of mongol preoccupations elsewhere rebuilt their forts at kaungsin and ngasaunggyan later in 1278 posting permanent garrisons commanded by einda pyissi but their control was short lived the great khan s attention turned to southeast asia once more in 1281 he had had mixed success his vaunted forces had finished off the last of the song in 1279 but had again failed to take japan in 1281 that year the mongol emperor sent another mission to pagan demanding tribute yet again the burmese king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor s court with champa the emperor summoned the king of champa himself to beijing
at pagan narathihapate deliberated with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit the burmese court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern burma he also ordered an invasion of champa whose king too had refused to submit the burmese king s troubles did not go unnoticed elsewhere in the kingdom in the same year a usurper named wareru seized the southern port city of martaban mottama by killing its pagan appointed governor although the king s three sons were viceroys of the nearby lower burma cities in bassein pathein prome pyay and dala the king preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north did not or could not take any action on martaban
throughout 1282 the mongol command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of champa and northern burma the objective of the burma campaign was to take over northern burma but no further the emperor did not sanction an attack on pagan itself at least one army consisted of 14 000 men of the erstwhile persian khwarezmid empire under the command of yalu beg was sent to yunnan to reinforce the burma invasion force which again was made up of turks and other central asians on the burmese side the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals he probably could not have raised a large one by mid 1283 a burmese army led by generals ananda pyissi and yanda pyissi was deployed at a fort at ngasaunggyan
invasion 1283 85
battle of ngasaunggyan 1283
the invasion began on 22 september 1283 prince sangqudar was the commander in chief of the invasion force his deputies were vice governor taipn and commander yagan tegin the mongol armies marched to the border in two columns one column advanced along the taping river using over 200 boats the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the burmese fort at ngasaunggyan the burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated the chronicles say that the burmese army numbered 400 000 men while the mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses the burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 december 1283
invasion of northern burma
the defeat at ngasaunggyan broke the back of burmese defenses the burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders kaungsin the next fort inline fell just six days later on 9 december 1283 the mongol sources say that the burmese lost 10 000 men at kaungsin the mongol armies pushed farther south into the irrawaddy valley they took the ancient burmese capital of tagaung about 380 km north of pagan on 5 february 1284 there the invaders paused their advance they found the heat of the searing irrawaddy valley excessive and evacuated tagaung allowing the burmese to return to tagaung on 10 may 1284 but the mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season they retook tagaung and defeated another burmese stand south of tagaung probably near hanlin on 26 january 1285 opening the way to pagan about 270 km south after the defeat the king panicked and fled to lower burma the evacuation proved premature the mongol forces did not advance on pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan
the country fell into chaos in lower burma the king found himself isolated let alone plan a counterattack although his sons ruled the key lower burma ports prome dala and bassein the king did not trust any of them and he and his court settled at hlegya west of prome without the full support of his sons the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one the governor of pegu revolted that same year the king managed to send two small expeditions to pegu but they both failed now the entire eastern half of lower burma pegu and martaban was in open revolt
peace negotiations 1285 87
ceasefire
given his precarious position narathihapate decided to buy time and sue for peace with the mongols in november december 1285 the king ordered his generals ananda pyissi and maha bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations the mongol commanders at hanlin who had organized northern burma as a protectorate named zhengmian chinese wade giles cheng mien agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission they repeated their 1281 demand that the burmese king send a formal delegation to the emperor the two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 march 1286 which calls for a full submission of the pagan empire and central burma to be organized as the province of mianzhong chinese wade giles mien chung after a long deliberation the king agreed to submit but wanted the mongol troops to withdraw in june 1286 he sent an embassy led by shin ditha pamauk a learned monk to the emperor s court
treaty of beijing
in january 1287 the embassy arrived at beijing and was received by the yuan emperor the burmese delegation formally acknowledged mongol suzerainty of their kingdom and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country indeed the tribute was no longer nominal in exchange the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops for the emperor the burma campaign was the only bright spot his other southeast asian expeditions had gone badly he did not want to invest more troops pacify the rest of the kingdom he preferred a vassal ruler the burmese embassy arrived back at hlegya in may 1287 and reported the terms to the king
breakdown
but the agreement broke down a month later in late june the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for pagan but on 1 july 1287 the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son thihathu the viceroy of prome anarchy ensued each region in the country which had not revolted broke away no successor to narathihapate who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of beijing emerged indeed a king would not emerge until may 1289
mongol intervention 1287
given the chaos the governor of yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation the mongol army commanded by prince ye sin timour a grandson of the emperor marched south toward pagan according to mainstream traditional british colonial era scholarship the mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate fought its way down to pagan with the loss of 7000 men occupied the city and sent out detachments to receive homage one of which reached south of prome but not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary mongol chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest
recent research shows that the mongol forces most probably never reached pagan they were held at bay by the burmese defenses led by commanders athinkhaya yazathingyan and thihathu and probably never got closer than 160 km north of pagan an inscription dated 16 february 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the mongol army even if the mongols did reach pagan the damage they inflicted was probably minimal at any rate the mongol army suffered heavy casualties and retreated north to tagaung they remained there as the treaty was now void
aftermath
the disintegration of the pagan empire was now complete but the mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created they would send no more expeditions to restore order the emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to pacify the fragmented country indeed his real aim all along may have been to keep the entire region of southeast asia broken and fragmented it would be another two years until one of narathihapate s sons kyawswa emerged as king of pagan in may 1289 but the new king controlled just a small area around the capital and had no real army the real power in central burma now rested with the three commander brothers
the uneasy arrangement would persist until 1297 the mongols continued to occupy northern burma to tagaung as the province of zhengmian cheng mien but ended the fictional central burma province of mianzhong on 18 august 1290 meanwhile the power struggle in central burma continued with the three brothers blatantly consolidating support to check their rising power kyawswa submitted to the mongols in january 1297 and was recognized by the yuan emperor tem r khan as king of pagan on 20 march 1297 the emperor also gave chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of kyawswa the brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power on 17 december 1297 the three brothers overthrew kyawswa and founded the myinsaing kingdom the dethronement forced the mongol government to intervene again leading to the second mongol invasion of burma 1300 01 the invasion failed two years later on 4 april 1303 the mongols abolished the province of zhengmian cheng mien evacuated tagaung and returned to yunnan
legacy
the war was one of several near simultaneous wars waged by the mongol empire and the yuan dynasty in the late 13th century though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the mongols the war set off a series of enduring developments in burma the invasions ushered in a period of political fragmentation and the rise of tai shan states throughout mainland southeast asia
age of political fragmentation
the immediate result of the war was the collapse of the pagan empire however the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it pagan s disintegration was in fact more prolonged and agonized the kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century had pagan possessed a stronger central government the collapse could have been temporary and the country could have risen again but the dynasty could not recover and because the mongols refused to fill the power vacuum no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath as a result several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century it was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the irrawaddy basin restoring some semblance of normalcy the vast region surrounding the irrawaddy valley would continue to be made up of several small tai shan states well into the 16th century
rise of tai shan states
perhaps the most enduring legacy of the mongol invasions was the emergence of tai shan states in mainland southeast asia the tai shan people who came down with the mongol invasions stayed by the early 14th century several tai shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present day assam to northern and eastern myanmar to northern and central thailand and laos their rise was encouraged by the mongols who viewed the states as a useful buffer between yunnan and the rest of southeast asia the mongols who were still trying to incorporate yunnan into the central administration were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of yunnan into the fold the integration of yunnan itself into china proper was to take several more centuries and continues to today as such from the newly formed tai shan states in western and central southeast asia to dai viet and champa in eastern southeast asia the mongols elected to receive nominal tribute though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the yuan government they were the native chieftains who would have ruled there in any case and they did as they pleased
arrival of china on the burmese border
the war also marked the arrival of china at the doorstep of burma the old dali kingdom known to the burmese as gandalarit after gandhara raj was now a mongol chinese province the burmese now called the new powers at yunnan taruk after the turkic speaking soldiers of yunnan over the years the term taruk came to be used to refer to the han chinese today king narathihapate is remembered as taruk pye min the king who fled from the taruk chinese from a geopolitical standpoint the mongol chinese presence in yunnan pushed the shan migrations in the direction of burma and parts of the khmer empire the raids by various shan states into upper burma would continue until the mid 16th century
mongolia myanmar relations
during the official visit by the president tsakhiagiin elbegdorj to myanmar in november 2013 aung san suu kyi the chairperson of national league for democracy said this was the first ever mongol mission since the mongols came 730 years earlier
battle of edson s ridge
the battle of edson s ridge also known as the battle of the bloody ridge battle of raiders ridge and battle of the ridge was a land battle of the pacific campaign of world war ii between imperial japanese army and allied mainly united states marine corps ground forces it took place from 12 14 september 1942 on guadalcanal in the solomon islands and was the second of three separate major japanese ground offensives during the guadalcanal campaign
in the battle u s marines under the overall command of u s major general alexander vandegrift repulsed an attack by the japanese 35th infantry brigade under the command of japanese major general kiyotake kawaguchi the marines were defending the lunga perimeter that guarded henderson field on guadalcanal which was captured from the japanese by the allies in landings on guadalcanal on 7 august 1942 kawaguchi s unit was sent to guadalcanal in response to the allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the allied forces from the island
underestimating the strength of allied forces on guadalcanal about 12 000 kawaguchi s 6 000 soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the u s defenses the main japanese assault occurred around lunga ridge south of henderson field manned by troops from several u s marine corps units primarily troops from the 1st raider and 1st parachute battalions under u s marine corps lieutenant colonel merritt a edson although the marine defenses were almost overrun kawaguchi s attack was ultimately defeated with heavy losses for the japanese
because of the key participation by edson s unit in defending the ridge the ridge was commonly referred to as edson s ridge in historical accounts of the battle in western sources after edson s ridge the japanese continued to send troops to guadalcanal for further attempts to retake henderson field affecting japanese offensive operations in other areas of the south pacific
background
guadalcanal campaign
on 7 august 1942 allied forces primarily u s landed on guadalcanal tulagi and florida islands in the solomon islands the landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the u s and australia they were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major japanese base at rabaul and support the allied new guinea campaign the landings initiated the six month long guadalcanal campaign
taking the japanese by surprise by nightfall on 8 august the allied landing forces had secured tulagi and nearby small islands as well as an airfield under construction at lunga point 9 25 45 s 160 3 4 e on the north shore of the island of guadalcanal east of the present day capital of honiara vandegrift placed his 11 000 troops of the 1st marine division on guadalcanal in a loose perimeter around the lunga point area
on 12 august the airfield was named henderson field after major lofton henderson a marine aviator who had been killed at the battle of midway the allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of henderson field were called the cactus air force after the allied code name for guadalcanal
in response to the allied landings on guadalcanal the japanese imperial general headquarters assigned the imperial japanese army s 17th army a corps sized command based at rabaul 4 11 56 s 152 9 57 e and under the command of lieutenant general harukichi hyakutake with the task of retaking guadalcanal from allied forces the 17th army heavily involved with the japanese campaign in new guinea had only a few units available to send to the southern solomons area of these units the 35th infantry brigade under major general kiyotake kawaguchi was at palau the 4th aoba infantry regiment was in the philippines and the 28th ichiki infantry regiment under the command of colonel kiyonao ichiki was embarked on transport ships near guam the different units began to move toward guadalcanal immediately ichiki s regiment the closest arrived first the first element of ichiki s unit consisting of about 917 soldiers landed from destroyers at taivu point 9 24 38 s 160 20 56 e about 18 mi 29 km east of the lunga perimeter on august 19
underestimating the strength of allied forces on guadalcanal ichiki s first element conducted a nighttime frontal assault on marine positions at alligator creek on the east side of the lunga perimeter in the early morning hours of august 21 ichiki s assault was repulsed with devastating losses for the attackers in what became known as the battle of the tenaru all but 128 of the 917 men of the first element including ichiki himself were killed in the battle the survivors returned to taivu point notified 17th army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from rabaul
by 23 august kawaguchi s unit had reached truk and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to guadalcanal because of the damage caused by allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the battle of the eastern solomons the japanese decided not to deliver kawaguchi s troops to guadalcanal by slow transport ship instead the ships carrying kawaguchi s soldiers were sent to rabaul from there the japanese planned to deliver kawaguchi s men to guadalcanal by destroyers staging through a japanese naval base in the shortland islands the japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down the slot to guadalcanal and back in a single night minimizing their exposure to allied air attack however most of the soldiers heavy equipment and supplies such as heavy artillery vehicles and much food and ammunition could not be taken to guadalcanal with them these high speed destroyer runs to guadalcanal which occurred throughout the campaign were later called the tokyo express by allied forces and rat transportation by the japanese the japanese controlled the seas around the solomon islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the allies however any japanese ship remaining within the 200 mi 320 km range of the aircraft at henderson field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks this curious tactical situation held for several months
troop movement
on 28 august 600 of kawaguchi s troops were loaded onto the destroyers asagiri amagiri yugiri and shirakumo designated destroyer division 20 dd20 because of a shortage of fuel dd20 could not make the entire round trip to guadalcanal at high speed in one night but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower speed which conserved fuel at 18 05 that day 11 u s dive bombers from vmsb 232 under the command of lt col richard mangrum flew from henderson field and located and attacked dd20 about 70 mi 110 km north of guadalcanal sinking asagiri and heavily damaging yugiri and shirakumo amagiri took shirakumo in tow and the three destroyers returned to the shortlands without completing their mission the attack on dd20 killed 62 of kawaguchi s soldiers and 94 crew members
subsequent express runs were more successful between 29 august and 4 september various japanese light cruisers destroyers and patrol boats were able to land almost 5 000 troops at taivu point including all of the 35th infantry brigade one battalion of the aoba regiment and the rest of ichiki s regiment general kawaguchi who landed at taivu point on the 31 august express run was placed in command of all the japanese troops on guadalcanal on the night of 4 5 september as three of the express destroyers y dachi hatsuyuki and murakumo prepared to shell henderson field after landing their troops they detected and sank two u s ships in the vicinity the small old destroyer transports called apds by the u s marines uss little and gregory that were used to shuttle allied troops around the guadalcanal tulagi area
in spite of the successes of the destroyer runs kawaguchi insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to guadalcanal by slow barges therefore a convoy carrying 1 100 of kawaguchi s troops and heavy equipment in 61 barges mainly from the 2nd battalion 124th infantry regiment under the command of colonel akinosuka oka departed the northern coast of santa isabel island on 2 september on 4 5 september aircraft from henderson field attacked the barge convoy killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit s heavy equipment most of the remaining 1 000 troops were able to land near kamimbo 9 15 32 s 159 40 18 e west of the lunga perimeter over the next few days by 7 september kawaguchi had 5 200 troops at taivu point and 1 000 west of the lunga perimeter kawaguchi was confident enough that he could defeat the allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces kawaguchi believed that there were only about 2 000 u s marines on guadalcanal
during this time vandegrift continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the lunga perimeter between 21 august and 3 september he relocated three marine battalions including the 1st raider battalion under u s lieutenant colonel merritt a edson edson s raiders and the 1st parachute battalion from tulagi and gavutu to guadalcanal these units added about 1 500 troops to vandegrift s original 11 000 men defending henderson field the 1st parachute battalion which had suffered heavy casualties in the battle of tulagi and gavutu tanambogo in august was placed under edson s command
battle
prelude
kawaguchi set the date for his attack on the lunga perimeter for 12 september and began marching his forces west from taivu towards lunga point on 5 september he radioed 17th army and requested that it carry out air strikes on henderson field beginning on 9 september and that naval warships be stationed off lunga point on september 12 to destroy any americans who attempted to flee from the island on 7 september kawaguchi issued his attack plan to rout and annihilate the enemy in the vicinity of the guadalcanal island airfield kawaguchi s plan called for his forces to split into three approach the lunga perimeter inland and launch a surprise night attack oka s force would attack the perimeter from the west while ichiki s second echelon renamed the kuma battalion would attack from the east the main attack would be by kawaguchi s center body numbering 3 000 men in three battalions from the south of the lunga perimeter by 7 september most of kawaguchi s troops had started marching from taivu towards lunga point along the coastline about 250 japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade s supply base at taivu
meanwhile native island scouts directed by british government official and officer in the british solomon islands protectorate defence force martin clemens told the marines of japanese troops at taivu near the village of tasimboko about 17 mi 27 km east of lunga edson launched a raid against the japanese troops at taivu destroyer transports uss mckean and manley and two patrol boats took 813 of edson s men to taivu in two trips edson and his first wave of 501 troops landed at taivu at 05 20 local time on 8 september supported by aircraft from henderson field and gunfire from the destroyer transports edson s men advanced towards tasimboko village but were slowed by japanese resistance at 11 00 the rest of edson s men landed with this reinforcement and more support from the henderson field aircraft edson s force pushed into the village the japanese defenders believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an allied supply ship convoy heading towards lunga point retreated into the jungle leaving behind 27 dead two marines were killed
in tasimboko edson s troops discovered the supply base for kawaguchi s forces including large stockpiles of food ammunition and medical supplies and a shortwave radio the marines seized documents equipment and food supplies destroyed the rest and returned to the lunga perimeter at 17 30 the quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3 000 japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack
edson and colonel gerald thomas vandegrift s operations officer believed that the japanese attack would come at the lunga ridge a narrow grassy 1 000 m 1 100 yd long coral ridge 9 26 39 s 160 2 50 e parallel to the lunga river just south of henderson field the ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended edson and thomas tried to persuade vandegrift to move forces to defend the ridge but vandegrift refused believing that the japanese were more likely to attack along the coast finally thomas convinced vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for edson s raiders to rest from their actions of the preceding month on 11 september the 840 men of edson s unit including the 1st raiders and the paramarines deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it
kawaguchi s center body of troops was planning to attack the lunga perimeter at the ridge which they called the centipede mukade gata because of its shape on 9 september kawaguchi s troops left the coast at koli point split into four columns they marched into the jungle towards their predesignated attack points south and southeast of the airfield lack of good maps at least one faulty compass and thick almost impenetrable jungle caused the japanese columns to proceed slowly and zigzag costing a lot of time at the same time oka s troops approached the lunga perimeter from the west oka had some intelligence on the marine defenses extracted from a u s army pilot captured on 30 august
during the day of 12 september kawaguchi s troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night s attacks kawaguchi wanted his three center body battalions in place by 14 00 but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22 00 oka was also delayed in his advance towards the marine lines in the west only the kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions kawaguchi was still confident in his attack plan because a captured u s pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the marine defenses japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11 12 september causing a few casualties including two killed
first night s action
the americans knew of the approach of the japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols but did not know exactly where or when they would attack the ridge around which edson deployed his men consisted of three distinct hillocks at the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was hill 80 so named because it rose 80 ft 24 m above sea level six hundred yards north was hill 123 123 ft 37 m high the dominant feature on the ridge the northernmost hillock was unnamed and about 60 ft 18 m high edson placed the five companies from the raider battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three parachute battalion companies on the east side holding positions in depth from hill 80 back to hill 123 two of the five raider companies b and c held a line between the ridge a small swampy lagoon and the lunga river machine gun teams from e company the heavy weapons company were scattered throughout the defenses edson placed his command post on hill 123
at 21 30 on 12 september the japanese cruiser sendai and three destroyers shelled the lunga perimeter for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight japanese artillery began shelling the marine lines but did little damage at the same time scattered groups of kawaguchi s troops began skirmishing with marines around the ridge kawaguchi s 1st battalion led by major yukichi kokusho attacked the raider s c company between the lagoon and the lunga river overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the marine company to fall back to the ridge kokusho s unit became entangled with troops from kawaguchi s 3rd battalion under lieutenant colonel kusukichi watanabe who were still struggling to reach their attack positions and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the japanese attack on the ridge that night kawaguchi who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the u s marine lines as well as coordinating his troops attacks later complained due to the devilish jungle the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control in my whole life i have never felt so disappointed and helpless twelve u s marines were killed japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater although both oka in the west and the kuma unit in the east tried to attack the marine lines that night they failed to make contact and halted near the marine lines at dawn
at first light on 13 september cactus air force aircraft and marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge forcing any japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle the japanese suffered several casualties including two officers from watanabe s battalion at 05 50 kawaguchi decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night
second night s action on the ridge
expecting the japanese to attack again that night edson directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge after a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground on the marine right flank lost to kokusho the night before edson repositioned his forces he pulled his front back about 400 yd 370 m to a line that stretched 1 800 yd 1 600 m starting at the lunga river and crossing the ridge about 150 yd 140 m south of hill 123 around and behind hill 123 he placed five companies any japanese attackers surmounting hill 80 would have to advance over 400 yd 370 m of open terrain to close with the marine positions at hill 123 with only a few hours to prepare the marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications they were low on ammunition with one or two grenades for each marine vandegrift ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd battalion 5th marine regiment 2 5 to move into a position just to the rear of edson s troops in addition a battery of four 105mm howitzers from the 11th marine regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge and a forward artillery observer was placed with edson s front line units
late in the afternoon edson stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops saying
you men have done a great job and i have just one more thing to ask of you hold out just one more night i know we ve been without sleep a long time but we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here i have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning
edson s speech raised the spirits of the raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead
as the sun set on 13 september kawaguchi faced edson s 830 marines with 3 000 troops of his brigade plus an assortment of light artillery the night was pitch black with no moon at 21 00 seven japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge kawaguchi s attack began just after nightfall with kokusho s battalion assaulting raider company b on the marine right flank just to the west of the ridge the force of the assault caused company b to fall back to hill 123 under marine artillery fire kokusho reassembled his men and continued his attack without pausing to try to roll up the other nearby marine units whose flanks were now unprotected kokusho s unit surged forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the lunga river heading for the airfield kokusho s men came upon a pile of marine supplies and rations not having eaten adequately for a couple of days they paused to gorge themselves on the c and k rations kokusho ordered his men to continue the attack at about 03 00 he led them against the marine units around the northern portion of the ridge just short of the airfield as well as hill 123 in the heavy fighting that followed kokusho and around 100 of his men were killed ending that attack
meanwhile kawaguchi s 2nd battalion under major masao tamura assembled for their planned assault against hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge marine observers spotted tamura s preparations and called in artillery fire at about 22 00 a barrage from twelve 105 mm 4 1 in guns hit tamura s position in response two companies of tamura s troops numbering about 320 men charged up hill 80 with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades tamura s attack hit company b of the marine parachute battalion and also raider company b pushing the parachutists off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the ridgeline to protect the exposed raider company b edson immediately ordered them to pull back onto hill 123
at the same time a japanese company from watanabe s battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and parachute company c deciding that their positions were now untenable parachute companies b and c climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind hill 123 in the darkness and confusion of the battle the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized a few marines began yelling that the japanese were attacking with poison gas scaring other marines who no longer possessed their gas masks after arriving behind hill 123 some of the marines continued on towards the airfield repeating the word withdraw to anyone within earshot other marines began to follow them just at the moment that it appeared that the marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a rout edson major kenneth d bailey from edson s staff and other marine officers appeared and with vivid language herded the marines back into defensive positions around hill 123
as the marines formed into a horseshoe shaped line around hill 123 tamura s battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill charging up the saddle from hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one japanese floatplane the marines repulsed the first two attacks by tamura s men tamura s troops hoisted a 75 mm 2 95 in regimental gun to the top of hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the marines this gun which could have turned the tide in favor of the japanese however was disabled by a faulty firing pin at midnight during a short lull in the fighting edson ordered parachute companies b and c to advance from behind hill 123 to strengthen his left flank with fixed bayonets the paramarines swept forward killing japanese soldiers who had overrun the marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the marine lines from the flank and took position on the east side of the hill marines from other units as well as members of edson s command staff including major bailey took ammunition and grenades under fire to the marines around hill 123 who were running critically low said marine participant captain william j mckennan the japanese attack was almost constant like a rain that subsides for a moment and then pours the harder when one wave was mowed down and i mean mowed down another followed it into death
the japanese hit edson s left flank just after the parachutists took position but were again stopped by marine rifle machine gun mortar and grenade fire marine 105 mm and 75 mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking japanese a captured japanese soldier later said that his unit was annihilated by the marine artillery fire which only 10 of his company survived
by 04 00 after withstanding several more assaults some of which resulted in hand to hand fighting and severe sniper fire from all sides edson s men were joined by troops from the 2nd battalion 5th marine regiment who helped repulse two more japanese attacks before dawn throughout the night as kawaguchi s men came close to overrunning the marine defenses edson remained standing about 20 yd 18 m behind the marine firing line on hill 123 exhorting his troops and directing their defensive efforts said marine captain tex smith who was in position to observe edson for most of the night i can say that if there is such a thing as one man holding a battalion together edson did it that night he stood just behind the front lines stood when most of us hugged the ground
during the heavy fighting portions of three japanese companies including two from tamura s and one from watanabe s battalions skirted the marine defenses on the ridge while suffering heavy losses from marine gunfire and reached the edge of fighter one a secondary runway of henderson field a counterattack by the marine engineers stopped one japanese company s advances and forced it to retreat the other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield when no reinforcements joined them both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after daybreak most of the rest of watanabe s battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night
as the sun rose on 14 september pockets of japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge but with tamura s battalion shattered after losing of its officers and men and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well kawaguchi s assault on the ridge had effectively ended about 100 japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of hill 80 perhaps preparing for one more charge on hill 123 at first light three u s army aircraft from the 67th fighter squadron at henderson field acting on a request personally delivered by bailey strafed the japanese near hill 80 and killed most of them with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle
kuma and oka attacks
as the battle on the ridge took place kawaguchi s kuma and oka units also attacked the marine defenses on the east and west sides of the lunga perimeter the kuma battalion led by major takeshi mizuno attacked the southeastern sector of the lunga perimeter defended by marines of the 3rd battalion 1st marine regiment 3 1 mizuno s attack started around midnight with one company attacking through marine artillery fire and engaging in hand to hand combat with the marine defenders before being thrown back mizuno was killed in the attack after daybreak the marines believing that the rest of mizuno s battalion was still in the area sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the marine lines four japanese 37 mm 1 46 in anti tank guns destroyed or disabled three of them after abandoning their burning tanks several of the disabled tanks crewmembers were bayoneted and killed by the japanese one tank tumbled down an embankment into the tenaru river drowning its crew
at 23 00 on 14 september the remnants of the kuma battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the marine lines but were repulsed a final weak attack by the kuma unit on the evening of 15 september was also defeated
oka s unit of about 650 men attacked the marines at several locations on the west side of the lunga perimeter at about 04 00 on 14 september two japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd battalion 5th marine regiment 3 5 near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses another japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 september the rest of oka s unit failed to find the marine lines and did not participate in the attack
aftermath
at 13 05 on 14 september kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day kawaguchi s units were then ordered to withdraw west to the matanikau river valley to join with oka s unit a 6 mi 9 7 km march over difficult terrain kawaguchi s troops began the march on the morning of 16 september almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded as the march progressed the exhausted and hungry soldiers who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal began to discard their heavy equipment and then their rifles by the time most of them reached oka s positions at kokumbona five days later only half still carried their weapons the kuma battalion s survivors attempting to follow kawaguchi s center body forces became lost wandered for three weeks in the jungle and almost starved to death before finally reaching kawaguchi s camp
in total kawaguchi s forces lost about 830 killed in the attack including 350 in tamura s battalion 200 in kokusho s battalion 120 in oka s force 100 in the kuma battalion and 60 in watanabe s battalion an unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the matanikau on and around the ridge the marines counted 500 japanese dead including 200 on the slopes of hill 123 the marines suffered 80 killed between 12 and 14 september
on 17 september vandegrift sent two companies from the 1st battalion 1st marine regiment 1 1 to pursue the retreating japanese the marines were ambushed by two japanese companies acting as rear guards for the withdrawal and one marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the marines retreated the marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by vandegrift by nightfall the japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon killing 24 marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving on 20 september a patrol from edson s raiders encountered stragglers from kawaguchi s retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them
as the japanese regrouped west of the matanikau the u s forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their lunga defenses on 14 september vandegrift moved another battalion the 3rd battalion 2nd marine regiment 3 2 from tulagi to guadalcanal on 18 september an allied naval convoy delivered 4 157 men from the 3rd provisional marine brigade the u s 7th marine regiment augmented by additional support units to guadalcanal these reinforcements allowed vandegrift beginning on 19 september to establish an unbroken line of defense around the lunga perimeter vandegrift s forces next significant clashes with the japanese occurred along the matanikau river from 23 27 september and 6 9 october
significance
on 15 september general hyakutake at rabaul learned of kawaguchi s defeat the imperial japanese army s first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war the general forwarded the news to the imperial general headquarters in japan in an emergency session the top japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that guadalcanal might develop into the decisive battle of the war the results of the battle began to have a telling strategic impact on japanese operations in other areas of the pacific hyakutake realized that in order to send sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the allied forces on guadalcanal he could no longer support the major japanese offensive on the kokoda track in new guinea hyakutake with the concurrence of the general headquarters ordered his troops on new guinea who were within 30 mi 48 km of their objective of port moresby to withdraw until the guadalcanal matter was resolved the japanese were never able to restart their drive towards port moresby the defeat at edson s ridge contributed not only to japan s defeat in the guadalcanal campaign but also to japan s ultimate defeat throughout the south pacific
after delivering more forces during the next month the japanese mounted a major ground offensive on guadalcanal led by hyakutake in late october 1942 at the battle for henderson field but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the japanese vandegrift later stated that kawaguchi s assault on the ridge in september was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded we would have been in a pretty bad condition historian richard b frank adds the japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in september 1942 on a ridge thrusting up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield best known ever after as bloody ridge
new jersey route 50
route 50 is a state highway in the southern part of the u s state of new jersey it runs 26 02 mi 41 88 km from an intersection with u s route 9 us 9 and the garden state parkway in upper township cape may county to an intersection with us 30 and county route 563 cr 563 in egg harbor city atlantic county the route which is mostly a two lane undivided road passes through mostly rural areas of atlantic and cape may counties as well as the communities of tuckahoe corbin city estell manor and mays landing nj 50 intersects several roads including route 49 in tuckahoe us 40 in mays landing and us 322 and the atlantic city expressway in hamilton township
the portion of current route 50 between seaville and petersburg received funding in 1910 to become a spur of the ocean highway in 1917 what is now route 50 was designated a part of pre 1927 route 14 a route that was to run from cape may to egg harbor city route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927 replacing this portion of pre 1927 route 14 in 1960 a freeway was proposed for route 50 running from the garden state parkway in dennis township to us 30 in mullica township this proposal was canceled by the mid 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic the interchange between route 50 and the atlantic city expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange with completion in june 2010
route description
route 50 begins at an intersection with us 9 in the seaville section of upper township cape may county heading to the north on a two lane undivided road from the southern terminus a ramp provides access to and from the southbound garden state parkway the road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings it intersects cr 671 in greenfield before coming to a junction with cr 616 later route 50 cedar swamp creek in an area of marshland at this crossing the road runs closely parallel to a conrail shared assets operations railroad line before entering petersburg where it splits from the railroad tracks and comes to a crossroad with cr 610 upon leaving petersburg route 50 turns to the north again and crosses over the conrail shared assets operations railroad line intersecting cr 631 it continues to tuckahoe and comes to cr 669 past this intersection the route meets cr 557 and cr 664 route 50 forms a concurrency with cr 557 and the two routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus of route 49 before leaving tuckahoe
not far after route 49 the road crosses the tuckahoe river into corbin city atlantic county in corbin city it heads into residential areas with cr 611 looping to the west of the route route 50 and cr 557 continue northwest and intersect cr 648 where the road turns north into more forested areas at the junction with cr 645 the route turns to the northeast and enters estell manor becoming broad street cr 557 splits from route 50 by heading northwest on buena tuckahoe road and route 50 heads through some agricultural clearings concurrent with cr 557 truck passing to the west of the macnamara wildlife area which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds the route intersects cr 637 turning to the northeast
after passing some homes and stephen lake the road turns to the north and passes to the west of estell manor county park the route crosses the south river into weymouth township passing the residential community of belcoville to the east and meeting cr 669 it soon enters hamilton township where the name of the road becomes mill street and it comes to a junction with us 40 harding highway cr 557 truck heads to the west on us 40 at this point while route 50 heads east on us 40 and cr 616 continues north
us 40 and nj 50 follow the harding highway a two lane undivided road turning to the northeast and crossing the great egg harbor river upon passing over the river enters mays landing and turns north encountering cr 617 before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of mays landing here the road crosses cr 559 and us 40 splits from nj 50 by turning east along that road meanwhile route 50 continues north on cape may avenue passing through developed areas it leaves mays landing and heads into back into forests the route turns to the northeast passing near the clover leaf lakes residential development before coming to an interchange with us 322 black horse pike
past this interchange route 50 widens to a four lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the atlantic city expressway the route becomes a two lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas crossing into galloway township where there is an intersection with cr 686 a short distance later the road crosses new jersey transit s atlantic city line near the egg harbor city station and enters egg harbor city turning into philadelphia avenue a block after the railroad crossing route 50 ends at an intersection with us 30 and cr 563 white horse pike with cr 563 continuing north on philadelphia avenue at this point
route 50 is an important route linking the atlantic city expressway with the jersey shore resorts in cape may county serving as an alternate to more congested routes it also serves as evacuation route from cape may county to inland areas in the event of a hurricane
history
the portion of current route 50 between seaville and petersburg received funding to become a spur of the ocean highway in 1910 the modern day alignment of route 50 was legislated as part of pre 1927 route 14 in 1917 a route that was to run from cape may to egg harbor city in the 1927 new jersey state highway renumbering the portion of pre 1927 route 14 between seaville and egg harbor city was designated as route 50 the highest state route number assigned in the renumbering route 50 retained its current routing in the 1953 new jersey state highway renumbering a freeway was proposed for route 50 around 1960 running from the garden state parkway in dennis township north to us 30 in mullica township this proposed freeway was intended to provide economic development to the region as well as provide a better route to the jersey shore resorts of cape may county for travelers from the delaware valley however this freeway was canceled by the mid 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic along route 50 on november 21 2008 construction began on making the interchange with the atlantic city expressway a full interchange as part of a series of improvements set for the atlantic city expressway this project was completed on june 18 2010

air rhodesia flight 825
air rhodesia flight 825 was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the zimbabwe people s revolutionary army zipra on 3 september 1978 during the rhodesian bush war the aircraft involved a vickers viscount named the hunyani was flying the last leg of air rhodesia s regular scheduled service from victoria falls to the capital salisbury via the resort town of kariba
soon after flight 825 took off a group of zipra guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a soviet made strela 2 surface to air infrared homing missile critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing an attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of karoi was foiled by an unseen ditch which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up of the 52 passengers and four crew 38 died in this crash the insurgents then approached the wreckage rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived
zipra leader joshua nkomo publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the hunyani in an interview with the bbc s today programme the same evening saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground the majority of rhodesians both black and white saw the attack as an act of terrorism a fierce white rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general even though few black rhodesians supported attacks of this kind reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as time magazine but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments much to the rhodesian government s indignation
talks between nkomo and prime minister ian smith which had been progressing promisingly were immediately suspended by the furious rhodesians with smith calling nkomo a monster on 10 september smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas the rhodesian security forces launched several retaliatory strikes into zambia and mozambique over the following months attacking both zipra and its rival the zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla the attack on zipra in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions five months later in february 1979 zipra shot down air rhodesia flight 827 another civilian flight in an almost identical incident
background
a dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self governing colony of rhodesia or southern rhodesia led the colonial government headed by prime minister ian smith to unilaterally declare independence from the united kingdom on 11 november 1965 the idea of no independence before majority rule had recently gained ground in britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation and rhodesia s government was dominated by the country s white minority so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally britain and the united nations imposed economic sanctions on rhodesia
two rival communist backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule the chinese aligned zimbabwe african national union zanu mostly comprising shonas created the zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla and adopted aspects of maoist doctrine while the ndebele dominated zimbabwe african people s union zapu aligned with soviet style marxism leninism and the warsaw pact mobilised the zimbabwe people s revolutionary army zipra these guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the second chimurenga against the rhodesian government and security forces the resulting conflict the rhodesian bush war began in earnest in december 1972 when zanla attacked altena and whistlefield farms in north eastern rhodesia
after the security forces mounted a successful counter insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 developments overseas caused the conflict s momentum to shift in the insurgents favour the leftist carnation revolution of april 1974 caused portugal to withdraw its key economic support for smith s administration and led to mozambique s independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with zanu around the same time rhodesia s other main backer south africa adopted a d tente initiative that forced a ceasefire giving the guerrillas time to regroup following the abortive victoria falls conference of august 1975 smith and the zapu leader joshua nkomo held unsuccessful talks between december 1975 and march 1976 zanu and zapu announced in october 1976 during the run up to the unsuccessful geneva conference in december that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint patriotic front
in march 1978 smith and non militant nationalist groups headed by bishop abel muzorewa the reverend ndabaningi sithole and chief jeremiah chirau agreed what became the internal settlement this created a joint black white transitional government with the country due to be reconstituted as zimbabwe rhodesia in june 1979 pursuant to multiracial elections zanu and zapu were invited to participate but refused nkomo sardonically dubbed smith s black colleagues the blacksmiths zanu proclaimed 1978 to be the year of the people as the war continued officials from muzorewa s united african national council sent to the provinces to explain the internal settlement to rural blacks were killed by marxist leninist guerrillas insurgents also began to target christian missionaries climaxing in the killing of nine british missionaries and four children at elim mission near the mozambican border on 23 june
the transitional government was badly received abroad partly because the internal settlement kept control of law enforcement the military the judiciary and the civil service under white control no country recognised rhodesia s interim administration smith again worked to bring nkomo into the government hoping this would lend it some credence domestically prompt diplomatic recognition overseas and help the security forces defeat zanla starting on 14 august 1978 he attended secret meetings with nkomo in lusaka zambia where zapu was based doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation lonrho attempts were made to also involve the zanu leader robert mugabe but mugabe would have no part in the talks according to the south african military historian jakkie cilliers negotiations between smith and nkomo progressed well and seemed on the verge of success by the start of september 1978 on 2 september smith and nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place
incident
prior threats to rhodesian air traffic
rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977 in the latter stages of the war before this time neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target the weapon that made such attacks feasible for zipra was the strela 2 shoulder launched surface to air missile launcher supplied by the soviet union from the mid 1970s as part of the warsaw pact s materiel support by september 1978 there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons none of which had been successful some rhodesian air force dakotas had been hit but all had survived and landed safely no civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the bush war
flight
air rhodesia was the country s national airline established by the government on 1 september 1967 to succeed central african airways which was dissolved at the end of that year based at salisbury airport air rhodesia s flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights as well as international services to the south african cities of johannesburg and durban
the flight 825 aircraft was a vickers viscount 782d a british made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing it was named the hunyani after the river of the same name which flowed between lake kariba and the rhodesian capital salisbury
the hunyani was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between victoria falls and salisbury stopping over in the resort town of kariba despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on kariba by zipra guerrillas on the northern side of the zambezi in zambia the resort had endured as one of rhodesia s choice tourist destinations the flight on 3 september 1978 sunday afternoon from kariba to salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers most of whom were holidaymakers from salisbury returning home after a weekend at the lake the flight took off from kariba airport on schedule soon after 17 00 central africa time
flight 825 was piloted by 36 year old captain john hood a native of bulawayo who had gained his commercial pilot licence in 1966 he had flown viscounts for air rhodesia since 1968 and had also served in the rhodesian air force on a voluntary basis his first officer garth beaumont was 31 years old and had lived in rhodesia for most of his life having immigrated as a child from south africa the two air stewardesses were dulcie esterhuizen 21 years old and from bulawayo and 23 year old louise pearson from salisbury
shootdown
a group of zipra guerrillas armed with a strela 2 launcher waited in the bush beneath flight 825 s flightpath and fired on the hunyani about five minutes after it took off while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight the heat seeking missile hit the plane s starboard wing and exploded causing the inner engine to also explode a fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured creating a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out the second starboard engine failed almost immediately leaving hood with only his two port engines heaving wildly the hunyani began to descend rapidly
at 17 10 captain hood sent a distress call to air traffic control informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash we re going in he radioed telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing he aimed for an open field of cotton in the whamira hills in the bush to the west of karoi intending to belly land the craft the landing was relatively stable until the hunyani hit a previously unseen ditch cartwheeled and exploded the remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire setting the wrecked cabin ablaze
massacre on the ground
of the 56 people on board 38 including hood and beaumont died in the crash eighteen survived albeit with injuries and climbed out of the wreckage after briefly settling the others one of the passengers dr cecil maclaren led four others young newlyweds robert and shannon hargreaves mrs sharon coles and her four year old daughter tracey off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water the other 13 remained close to the wreckage meanwhile nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site and reached it at about 17 45 three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching rhodesian army reservist anthony hill 39 took cover in the surrounding bush while businessman hans hansen and his wife diana did the same this left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage including four women and two girls aged 11 and 4
the guerrillas who were armed with ak 47 rifles presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly saying they would summon help and bring water they spoke in english both to the survivors and among themselves they told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk the insurgents told the able bodied men to carry the others the passengers were assembled into an area of about 10 square metres 110 sq ft standing roughly 15 metres 49 ft away the cadres now raised their weapons you have taken our land one of them said please don t shoot us one of the passengers cried just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire
having collected water from the nearby village maclaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat they continued on their way and called out to the other passengers who they thought were still alive this alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors one of the guerrillas told maclaren s group to come here the insurgents then opened fire on their general location prompting maclaren and the others to flee hill and the hansens also ran they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge after hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19 45 the guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site filled their arms with various passengers belongings then left again
the survivors were found over the following days by the rhodesian army and police hill and mr and mrs hansen were taken to kariba hospital while maclaren and his group were airlifted to andrew fleming hospital in salisbury
nkomo claims responsibility but denies killing survivors
nkomo claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the bbc s today radio programme the next day laughing as he did so to the horror of most rhodesian observers both black and white he said that he had received intelligence that the hunyani was being used for military purposes nkomo said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party s policy to kill civilians and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground by contrast he said that his men had helped them and had left them alive he also accused air rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war materiel for the government an allegation that captain pat travers air rhodesia s general manager called a downright deliberate lie
according to eliakim sibanda a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of zapu nkomo was implying that responsibility for the massacre actually lay with security force pseudo guerrillas more specifically the mixed race selous scouts unit which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion sibanda asserts that the massacre cannot be put beyond the scouts and also supports nkomo s claim that the hunyani had been used militarily suggesting that zipra might have believed there to be rhodesian soldiers on board rhodesian television before attacks on zanla in mozambique had shown viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job he writes and zipra intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed at victoria falls
reactions
white rhodesians turn against blacks
a report published in the american magazine time a fortnight later described the incident as a genuine horror story calculated to make the most alarming of rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true indeed the white community in rhodesia heard the news with fury and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism the prominent indian rhodesian gulab family was particularly affected by the incident having lost eight members in the attack though rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash doing so only after four days investigation the truth was common knowledge in salisbury within hours smith wrote in his memoirs that the degree of anger was difficult to control white south africans were similarly enraged particularly after reports appeared in the south african press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring them a friends of rhodesia society in south africa offered a reward of r100 000 to anybody who would either kill nkomo or bring him to salisbury to stand trial
geoffrey nyarota who was then one of the few black reporters at the rhodesia herald newspaper later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general believing them all to be terrorist sympathisers describing the herald newsroom the night of the incident he relates a vile collective temper among the white sub editors they cursed until their voices became hoarse threatening dire consequences for all terrs and munts or kaffirs i sensed that some of the more derogatory remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears
several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days according to the time article a group of whites entered an unsegregated salisbury bar fingering the triggers of rifles and forced blacks drinking there to leave time also reported a rumour that two white youths on learning of the massacre shot the first black man they saw smith says that several would be vigilante groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to make the local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting the terrorists he instructed them not to according to his memoirs telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress and that it would not do to attack them many rhodesians also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target
memorial service 8 september 1978
at a memorial service held on 8 september 1978 for flight 825 s passengers and crew at salisbury s anglican cathedral about 2 000 people crowded inside with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed air rhodesia and south african airways personnel as well as rhodesian special air service soldiers and senior officers from other military units smith and several government ministers also attended including p k van der byl the co minister of foreign affairs
dean john de costa gave a sermon damning what he described as a deafening silence from overseas nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the viscount he said but are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised we are not like men in the story of the good samaritan they pass by on the other side the ghastliness of this ill fated flight from kariba will be burnt upon our memories for years to come for others far from our borders it is an intellectual matter not one which affects them deeply here is the tragedy
smith nkomo talks halted
the talks between smith and the zapu leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by salisbury smith himself called nkomo a monster cilliers comments that the ending of the smith nkomo talks at this time was potentially the most serious result of the viscount massacre as the talks had been progressing well before the incident he surmises that an agreement between the two at this critical stage might have helped the transitional rhodesian government to secure international recognition
on 10 september the prime minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed he declared rhodesia s intent to liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for any defensive strikes we might undertake against guerrilla bases in their respective territories he claimed that the war had escalated because britain and the united states were supporting the patriotic front william irvine the co minister of transport warned the guerrillas that rhodesia w ould not let these innocents go unavenged
rhodesia strikes back
operation snoopy rhodesia hits new chimoio
because zapu and zipra were based in zambia many rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country but the first external target hit by the security forces following the viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of zanla bases around chimoio in mozambique the rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in november 1977 during operation dingo destroying much of the zanla presence there but the insurgents had since built a complex called new chimoio slightly to the east the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals in a combined airborne ground assault called operation snoopy the rhodesian air force rhodesian light infantry and special air service wiped out much of new chimoio on 20 september 1978 mozambique sent armour to zanla s aid in the form of nine soviet made t 54 tanks and four russian btr 152 armoured personnel carriers but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the rhodesian security forces according to rhodesian figures there were several hundred guerrillas killed while the security forces lost only two soldiers one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike
operation gatling the green leader raid
rhodesia then attacked zipra s bases in zambia in what group captain peter petter bowyer later described as payback time for flight 825 operation gatling launched on 19 october 1978 was another joint force operation between the air force and the army which contributed special air service and rhodesian light infantry paratroopers gatling s primary target just 16 kilometres 10 miles north east of central lusaka was the formerly white owned westlands farm which had been transformed into zipra s main headquarters and training base under the name freedom camp zipra presumed that rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to lusaka about 4 000 guerrillas underwent training at freedom camp with senior zipra staff also on site the rhodesian operation s other targets were chikumbi 19 kilometres 12 miles north of lusaka and mkushi camp all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across zambia assaulting targets deep inside zambia was a first for the rhodesian forces previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked
led by squadron leader chris dixon who identified himself to lusaka airport tower as green leader a rhodesian air force group flew into zambia at very low altitudes thereby avoiding zambian radar and took control of the country s airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on westlands farm informing lusaka tower that the attack was against rhodesian dissidents and not against zambia and that rhodesian hawker hunters were circling the zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off the zambians obeyed all of green leader s instructions made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic using rufunsa airstrip in eastern zambia as a forward base the rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three day operation and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1 500 zipra personnel as well as some cuban instructors
historians paul moorcraft and peter mclaughlin write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed as most of nkomo s army then numbering about 10 000 fighters had not been touched on the other hand unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions and hundreds of these had been killed in the rhodesian raid moorcraft and mclaughlin comment that for the rhodesian airmen it would have been impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young zipra recruits sibanda describes freedom camp as a refugee camp for boys and says 351 boys and girls were killed he claims that the red cross and the un refugee agency confirmed zapu s claim that smith s forces struck at defenseless civilian trainees
aftermath
the rhodesian attacks on zanla and zipra bases did much to restore white morale following the viscount incident though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns nkomo and the zambian president kenneth kaunda all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the soviets and the british respectively martial law was quickly extended across rhodesia s rural areas and covered three quarters of the country by the end of 1978 air rhodesia meanwhile began developing anti strela shielding for its viscounts before this work was completed zipra shot down a second viscount air rhodesia flight 827 on 12 february 1979 this time there were no survivors
following the second shootdown air rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the viscounts would be coated with low radiation paint with the exhaust pipes concurrently shrouded according to tests conducted by the air force a viscount so treated could not be detected by the strela s targeting system once it was over 2 000 feet 610 m there were no further viscount shootdowns in rhodesia
in the elections held the following year under the internal settlement terms boycotted by zanu and zapu muzorewa won a majority and became the first prime minister of the reconstituted majority ruled state of zimbabwe rhodesia on 1 june 1979 this new order failed to win international acceptance however and in december 1979 the lancaster house agreement was agreed in london by zimbabwe rhodesia the uk government and the patriotic front returning the country to its former colonial status the uk government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period fresh elections were won by mugabe who took power in april 1980 concurrently with the country s recognised independence as zimbabwe
legacy and memorial
in modern zimbabwe it is not the viscount shootdowns but rather the retributory rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory state media in zimbabwe prominently the herald newspaper often claim that rhodesian forces indiscriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during such operations zipra s downing of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board the massacre of surviving flight 825 passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than zipra in his 1984 memoirs nkomo repeated his claim that zipra fighters had helped the survivors and wrote simply that i truly have no idea how the ten died
a monument to those killed in the rhodesian attack on chikumbi was built in zambia in 1998 and dedicated jointly by the zambian and zimbabwean governments a memorial to the victims of the two rhodesian viscount incidents dubbed the viscount memorial was erected on the grounds of the voortrekker monument in pretoria south africa in 2012 and inaugurated on 1 september that year the names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright side by side the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft a pole beside the monument flies the rhodesian flag
a british parliamentary motion put forward by labour mp kate hoey in february 2013 to retrospectively condemn the viscount attacks and memorialise the victims on the anniversary of the second shootdown prompted outcry in the zimbabwean press with the herald branding it a racist rhodie motion intended to antagonise the mugabe administration and its supporters dumiso dabengwa a former zipra commander described the move as a provocation motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at lancaster house christopher mutsvangwa a diplomat and political analyst took a similar line calling hoey s proposed commemoration a provocation that means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle there is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country zapu s official response to hoey s motion included the assertion that in all conflicts civilians get caught up in cross fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the viscount shootdowns with those killed at chikumbi
newspaper and journal articles
tikal
tikal ti k l tik al in modern mayan orthography is the ruins of an ancient city found in a rainforest in guatemala ambrosio tut a gum sapper reported the ruins to la gaceta a guatemalan newspaper which named the site tikal after the berlin academy of sciences magazine republished the report in 1853 archeologists and treasure hunters began visiting the forest today tourism to the site may help protect the rainforest it is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre columbian maya civilization it is located in the archaeological region of the pet n basin in what is now northern guatemala situated in the department of el pet n the site is part of guatemala s tikal national park and in 1979 it was declared a unesco world heritage site
tikal was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient maya though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century bc tikal reached its apogee during the classic period c 200 to 900 ad during this time the city dominated much of the maya region politically economically and militarily while interacting with areas throughout mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of teotihuacan in the distant valley of mexico there is evidence that tikal was conquered by teotihuacan in the 4th century ad following the end of the late classic period no new major monuments were built at tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned these events were coupled with a gradual population decline culminating with the site s abandonment by the end of the 10th century
tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland maya cities with a long dynastic ruler list the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments temples and palaces
etymology
the name tikal may be derived from ti ak al in the yucatec maya language it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning at the waterhole the name was apparently applied to one of the site s ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region it has alternatively been interpreted as meaning the place of the voices in the itza maya language tikal however is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s hieroglyphic inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as yax mutal or yax mutul meaning first mutal tikal may have come to have been called this because dos pilas also came to use the same emblem glyph the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name the kingdom as a whole was simply called mutul which is the reading of the hair bundle emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo its precise meaning remains obscure
location
the closest large modern settlements are flores and santa elena approximately 64 kilometres 40 mi by road to the southwest tikal is approximately 303 kilometres 188 mi north of guatemala city it is 19 kilometres 12 mi south of the contemporary maya city of uaxactun and 30 kilometres 19 mi northwest of yaxha the city was located 100 kilometres 62 mi southeast of its great classic period rival calakmul and 85 kilometres 53 mi northwest of calakmul s ally caracol now in belize
the city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than 16 square kilometres 6 2 sq mi that included about 3 000 structures the topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands the major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised causeways spanning the swamps the area around tikal has been declared as the tikal national park and the preserved area covers 570 square kilometres 220 sq mi
the ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern guatemala that formed the cradle of lowland maya civilization the city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils and may have dominated a natural east west trade route across the yucatan peninsula conspicuous trees at the tikal park include gigantic kapok ceiba pentandra the sacred tree of the maya tropical cedar cedrela odorata and honduras mahogany swietenia macrophylla regarding the fauna agouti white nosed coatis gray foxes geoffroy s spider monkeys howler monkeys harpy eagles falcons ocellated turkeys guans toucans green parrots and leafcutter ants can be seen there regularly jaguars jaguarundis and cougars are also said to roam in the park for centuries this city was completely covered under jungle the average annual rainfall at tikal is 1 945 millimetres 76 6 in
one of the largest of the classic maya cities tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored in ten reservoirs archaeologists working in tikal during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use
the tikal national park covers an area of 575 83 square kilometres 222 33 sq mi it was created on 26 may 1955 under the auspices of the instituto de antropolog a e historia and was the first protected area in guatemala
population
population estimates for tikal vary from 10 000 to as high as 90 000 inhabitants with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range
the population of tikal began a continuous curve of growth starting in the preclassic period approximately 2000 bc ad 200 with a peak in the late classic with the population growing rapidly from ad 700 through to 830 followed by a sharp decline for the 120 square kilometres 46 sq mi area falling within the earthwork defenses of the hinterland the peak population is estimated at 517 per square kilometer 1340 per square mile in an area within a 12 kilometres 7 5 mi radius of the site core peak population is estimated at 120 000 population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer 689 per square mile in a region within a 25 kilometres 16 mi radius of the site core and including some satellite sites peak population is estimated at 425 000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer 515 per square mile these population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive swamplands that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture however some archaeologists such as david webster believe these figures to be far too high
rulers
the dynastic line of tikal founded as early as the 1st century ad spanned 800 years and included at least 33 rulers
history
preclassic
there are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as 1000 bc in the middle preclassic a cache of mamon ceramics dating from about 700 400 bc were found in a sealed chultun a subterranean bottle shaped chamber
major construction at tikal was already taking place in the late preclassic period first appearing around 400 300 bc including the building of major pyramids and platforms although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as el mirador and nakbe at this time tikal participated in the widespread chikanel culture that dominated the central and northern maya areas at this time a region that included the entire yucatan peninsula including northern and eastern guatemala and all of belize
two temples dating to late chikanel times had masonry walled superstructures that may have been corbel vaulted although this has not been proven one of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a scrollwork background painted in yellow black pink and red
in the 1st century ad rich burials first appeared and tikal underwent a political and cultural florescence as its giant northern neighbors declined at the end of the late preclassic the izapan style art and architecture from the pacific coast began to influence tikal as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the acropolis and early murals at the city
early classic
dynastic rulership among the lowland maya is most deeply rooted at tikal according to later hieroglyphic records the dynasty was founded by yax moch xoc perhaps in the 3rd century ad at the beginning of the early classic power in the maya region was concentrated at tikal and calakmul in the core of the maya heartland
tikal may have benefited from the collapse of the large preclassic states such as el mirador in the early classic tikal rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the maya region stimulating the development of other nearby maya cities
the site however was often at war and inscriptions tell of alliances and conflict with other maya states including uaxactun caracol naranjo and calakmul the site was defeated at the end of the early classic by caracol which rose to take tikal s place as the paramount center in the southern maya lowlands the earlier part of the early classic saw hostilities between tikal and its neighbor uaxactun with uaxactun recording the capture of prisoners from tikal
there appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by ad 317 when lady unen bahlam conducted a katun ending ceremony apparently as queen of the city
tikal and teotihuacan
the fourteenth king of tikal was chak tok ich aak great jaguar paw chak tok ich aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the central acropolis little is known about chak tok ich aak except that he was killed on 14 january 378 ad on the same day siyah k ak fire is born arrived from the west having passed through el peru a site to the west of tikal on 8 january on stela 31 he is named as lord of the west siyah k ak was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non maya hieroglyph of a spearthrower combined with an owl a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of teotihuacan in the distant valley of mexico spearthrower owl may even have been the ruler of teotihuacan these recorded events strongly suggest that siyah k ak led a teotihuacan invasion that defeated the native tikal king who was captured and immediately executed siyah k ak appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at tikal itself roughly at the time of the conquest a group of teotihuacan natives were apparently residing near the lost world complex he also exerted control over other cities in the area including uaxactun where he became king but did not take the throne of tikal for himself within a year the son of spearthrower owl by the name of yax nuun ayiin i first crocodile had been installed as the tenth king of tikal while he was still a boy being enthroned on 13 september 379 he reigned for 47 years as king of tikal and remained a vassal of siyah k ak for as long as the latter lived it seems likely that yax nuun ayiin i took a wife from the preexisting defeated tikal dynasty and thus legitimized the right to rule of his son siyaj chan k awiil ii
r o azul a small site 100 kilometres 62 mi northeast of tikal was conquered by the latter during the reign of yax nuun ayiin i the site became an outpost of tikal shielding it from hostile cities further north and also became a trade link to the caribbean
although the new rulers of tikal were foreign their descendants were rapidly mayanized tikal became the key ally and trading partner of teotihuacan in the maya lowlands after being conquered by teotihuacan tikal rapidly dominated the northern and eastern peten uaxactun together with smaller towns in the region were absorbed into tikal s kingdom other sites such as bejucal and motul de san jos near lake pet n itz became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north by the middle of the 5th century tikal had a core territory of at least 25 kilometres 16 mi in every direction
around the 5th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of tikal s hinterland joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of swampland lying to the east and west of the city additional fortifications were probably also built to the south these defenses protected tikal s core population and agricultural resources encircling an area of approximately 120 square kilometres 46 sq mi recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose
tikal and cop n
in the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as cop n whose founder k inich yax k uk mo was clearly connected with tikal cop n itself was not in an ethnically maya region and the founding of the cop n dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of tikal k inich yax k uk mo arrived in cop n in december 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at tikal an individual known as ajaw k uk mo lord k uk mo is referred to in an early text at tikal and may well be the same person his tomb had teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of teotihuacan hieroglyphic texts refer to him as lord of the west much like siyah k ak at the same time in late 426 cop n founded the nearby site of quirigu possibly sponsored by tikal itself the founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose tikal s authority upon the southeastern portion of the maya region the interaction between these sites and tikal was intense over the next three centuries
a long running rivalry between tikal and calakmul began in the 6th century with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile alliances arrayed against each other in what has been likened to a long running war between two maya superpowers the kings of these two capitals adopted the title kaloomte a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to high king
the early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city known only as the lady of tikal who was very likely a daughter of chak tok ich aak ii she seems never to have ruled in her own right rather being partnered with male co rulers the first of these was kaloomte b alam who seems to have had a long career as a general at tikal before becoming co ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence the lady of tikal herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering it appears she was later paired with lord bird claw who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler
late classic
tikal hiatus
in the mid 6th century caracol seems to have allied with calakmul and defeated tikal closing the early classic the tikal hiatus refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large scale construction at tikal in the latter half of the 6th century ad a serious crisis befell the city with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture this hiatus in activity at tikal was long unexplained until later epigraphic decipherments identified that the period was prompted by tikal s comprehensive defeat at the hands of calakmul and the caracol polity in ad 562 a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of tikal the badly eroded altar 21 at caracol described how tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in april 562 it seems that caracol was an ally of calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and tikal with the defeat of tikal having a lasting impact upon the city tikal was not sacked but its power and influence were broken after its great victory caracol grew rapidly and some of tikal s population may have been forcibly relocated there during the hiatus period at least one ruler of tikal took refuge with janaab pakal of palenque another of calakmul s victims calakmul itself thrived during tikal s long hiatus period
the beginning of the tikal hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly subdivide the classic period of mesoamerican chronology into the early and late classic
tikal and dos pilas
in 629 tikal founded dos pilas some 110 kilometres 68 mi to the southwest as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the pasi n river b alaj chan k awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four in 635 and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother the king of tikal roughly twenty years later dos pilas was attacked by calakmul and was soundly defeated b alaj chan k awiil was captured by the king of calakmul but instead of being sacrificed he was re instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy and attacked tikal in 657 forcing nuun ujol chaak the then king of tikal to temporarily abandon the city the first two rulers of dos pilas continued to use the mutal emblem glyph of tikal and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of tikal itself for some reason b alaj chan k awiil was not installed as the new ruler of tikal instead he stayed at dos pilas tikal counterattacked against dos pilas in 672 driving b alaj chan k awiil into an exile that lasted five years calakmul tried to encircle tikal within an area dominated by its allies such as el peru dos pilas and caracol
in 682 jasaw chan k awiil i erected the first dated monument at tikal in 120 years and claimed the title of kaloomte so ending the hiatus he initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on calakmul when in 695 he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered after this calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory
tikal after teotihuac n
by the 7th century there was no active teotihuacan presence at any maya site and the center of teotihuacan had been razed by 700 even after this formal war attire illustrated on monuments was teotihuacan style jasaw chan k awiil i and his heir yik in chan k awiil continued hostilities against calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around tikal extending as far as the territory around lake pet n itz these two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today
in 738 quirigu a vassal of cop n tikal s key ally in the south switched allegiance to calakmul defeated cop n and gained its own independence it appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of calakmul to bring about the collapse of tikal s southern allies this upset the balance of power in the southern maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of cop n
in the 8th century the rulers of tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the north acropolis by the late 8th century and early 9th century activity at tikal slowed impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers
terminal classic
by the 9th century the crisis of the classic maya collapse was sweeping across the region with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence increasingly endemic warfare in the maya region caused tikal s supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline construction continued at the beginning of the century with the erection of temple 3 the last of the city s major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th k atun in 810 the beginning of the 10th bak tun in 830 passed uncelebrated and marks the beginning of a 60 year hiatus probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city during this hiatus satellite sites traditionally under tikal s control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the mutal emblem glyph with tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence in 849 jewel k awiil is mentioned on a stela at seibal as visiting that city as the divine lord of tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and tikal s once great power was little more than a memory the sites of ixlu and jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive mutal emblem glyph
as tikal and its hinterland reached peak population the area suffered deforestation erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels tikal and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from 830 to 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly there is not much evidence from tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the maya region during the terminal classic although an influx of refugees from the petexbat n region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources
in the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of tikal as evidenced by a stela erected in the great plaza by jasaw chan k awiil ii in 869 this was the last monument erected at tikal before the city finally fell into silence the former satellites of tikal such as jimbal and uaxactun did not last much longer erecting their final monuments in 889 by the end of the 9th century the vast majority of tikal s population had deserted the city its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city s ceremonial plazas the squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non utilitarian items such as musical instruments these inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared with the tombs of the north acropolis being explored for jade and the easier to find tombs being looted after 950 tikal was all but deserted although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next thousand years some of tikal s population may have migrated to the peten lakes region which remained heavily populated in spite of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the 9th century
the most likely cause of collapse at tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure the fall of tikal was a blow to the heart of classic maya civilization the city having been at the forefront of courtly life art and architecture for over a thousand years with an ancient ruling dynasty however new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of tikal
modern history
in 1525 the spanish conquistador hern n cort s passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of tikal but did not mention them in his letters after spanish friar andr s de avenda o became lost in the pet n forests in early 1696 he described a ruin that may well have been tikal
as is often the case with huge ancient ruins knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region it seems that local people never forgot about tikal and they guided guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s some second or third hand accounts of tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century continuing through the writings of john lloyd stephens in the early 19th century stephens and his illustrator frederick catherwood heard rumors of a lost city with white building tops towering above the jungle during their 1839 40 travels in the region because of the site s remoteness from modern towns however no explorers visited tikal until modesto m ndez and ambrosio tut respectively the commissioner and the governor of pet n visited it in 1848 artist eusebio lara accompanied them and their account was published in germany in 1853 several other expeditions came to further investigate map and photograph tikal in the 19th century including alfred p maudslay in 1881 82 and the early 20th century pioneering archaeologists started to clear map and record the ruins in the 1880s
in 1951 a small airstrip was built at the ruins which previously could only be reached by several days travel through the jungle on foot or mule in 1956 the tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the maya area from 1956 through 1970 major archaeological excavations were carried out by the university of pennsylvania tikal project they mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures excavations directed by edwin m shook and later by william coe of the university investigated the north acropolis and the central plaza from 1957 to 1969 the tikal project recorded over 200 monuments at the site in 1979 the guatemalan government began a further archeological project at tikal which continued through to 1984
filmmaker george lucas used tikal as a filming location for the first star wars film episode iv a new hope released in 1977 temple i at tikal was featured on the reverse of the 50 centavo banknote
tikal is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park a site museum has been built at tikal it was completed in 1964
site description
tikal has been partially restored by the university of pennsylvania and the government of guatemala it was one of the largest of the classic period maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the americas the architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over 70 metres 230 ft high large royal palaces in addition to a number of smaller pyramids palaces residences administrative buildings platforms and inscribed stone monuments there is even a building which seemed to have been a jail originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors there are also seven courts for playing the mesoamerican ballgame including a set of 3 in the seven temples plaza a unique feature in mesoamerica
the limestone used for construction was local and quarried on site the depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to waterproof them and were used as reservoirs together with some waterproofed natural depressions the main plazas were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that channelled rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs
the residential area of tikal covers an estimated 60 square kilometres 23 sq mi much of which has not yet been cleared mapped or excavated a huge set of earthworks discovered by dennis e puleston and donald callender in the 1960s rings tikal with a 6 metre 20 ft wide trench behind a rampart the 16 square kilometres 6 2 sq mi area around the site core has been intensively mapped it may have enclosed an area of some 125 square kilometres 48 sq mi see below population estimates place the demographic size of the site between 10 000 and 90 000 and possibly 425 000 in the surrounding area recently a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is inconsequential as a defensive feature in addition some parts of the earthwork were integrated into a canal system the earthwork of tikal varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and multifaceted than originally thought
causeways
by the late classic a network of sacbeob causeways linked various parts of the city running for several kilometres through its urban core these linked the great plaza with temple 4 located about 750 metres 2 460 ft to the west and the temple of the inscriptions about 1 kilometre 0 62 mi to the southeast these broad causeways were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists the maler maudslay tozzer and m ndez causeways they assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams
the maler causeway runs north from behind temple i to group h a large bas relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of group h it depicts two bound captives and dates to the late classic
the maudsley causeway runs 0 8 kilometres 0 50 mi northeast from temple iv to group h
the mendez causeway runs southeast from the east plaza to temple vi a distance of about 1 3 kilometres 0 81 mi
the tozzer causeway runs west from the great plaza to temple iv

the great plaza lies at the core of the site it is flanked on the east and west sides by two great temple pyramids on the north side it is bordered by the north acropolis and on the south by the central acropolis
the central acropolis is a palace complex just south of the great plaza
the north acropolis together with the great plaza immediately to the south is one of the most studied architectural groups in the maya area the tikal project excavated a massive trench across the complex thoroughly investigating its construction history it is a complex group with construction beginning in the preclassic period around 350 bc it developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the classic period with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures after ad 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier northern platform which measured 100 by 80 metres 330 by 260 ft gradually hiding it from view eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century ad each of them had an elaborate roofcomb and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods by the 9th century ad 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the north acropolis 18 of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits the north acropolis continued to receive burials into the postclassic period
the south acropolis is found next to temple v it was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than 20 000 square metres 220 000 sq ft
the plaza of the seven temples is to the west of the south acropolis it is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side
the mundo perdido is to the west of the plaza of the seven temples it is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the preclassic period at tikal the complex was organized as a large e group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples the mundo perdido complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history by ad 250 300 its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of teotihuacan in the valley of mexico including the use of the talud tablero form during the early classic period c 250 600 the mundo perdido became one of the twin foci of the city the other being the north acropolis from ad 250 to 378 it may have served as the royal necropolis the mundo perdido complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the university of pennsylvania it is centered upon the lost world pyramid and a small platform to the west of it
group g lies just south of the mendez causeway the complex dates to the late classic and consists of palace type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at tikal it has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor a total of 29 vaulted chambers the remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey one of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask
group h is centered on a large plaza to the north of the great plaza it is bordered by temples dating to the late classic
there are nine twin pyramid complexes at tikal one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed they vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east west axis these pyramids are flat topped and have stairways on all four sides a row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids and lying roughly equidistant from them there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair on the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine doorways the entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20 year or k atun intervals during the late classic the first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the east plaza it was once thought that these complexes were unique to tikal but rare examples have now been found at other sites such as yaxha and ixlu and they may reflect the extent of tikal s political dominance in the late classic
group q is a twin pyramid complex and is one of the largest at tikal it was built by yax nuun ayiin ii in 771 in order to mark the end of the 17th k atun most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re erected
group r is another twin pyramid complex dated to 790 it is close to the maler causeway
structures
there are thousands of ancient structures at tikal and only a fraction of these have been excavated after decades of archaeological work the most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids labelled temples i vi each of which support a temple structure on their summits some of these pyramids are over 60 metres 200 feet high they were numbered sequentially during the early survey of the site it is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years
temple i also known as the temple of ah cacao or temple of the great jaguar is a funerary pyramid dedicated to jasaw chan k awil who was entombed in the structure in ad 734 the pyramid was completed around 740 750 the temple rises 47 metres 154 ft high the massive roofcomb that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king although little of this decoration survives the tomb of the king was discovered by aubrey trik of the university of pennsylvania in 1962 among items recovered from the late classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people finely carved and rubbed with vermilion as well as jade and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink the shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers each behind the next with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels fashioned from multiple beams the outermost lintel is plain but the two inner lintels were carved some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown while others were taken to museums in europe
temple ii also known as the temple of the mask it was built around ad 700 and stands 38 metres 125 ft high like other major temples at tikal the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels only the middle of which was carved the temple was dedicated to the wife of jasaw chan k awil although no tomb was found the queen s portrait was carved into the lintel spanning the doorway of the summit shrine one of the beams from this lintel is now in the american museum of natural history in new york
temple iii also known as the temple of the jaguar priest was the last of the great pyramids to be built at tikal it stood 55 metres 180 ft tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof lintel possibly showing dark sun engaged in a ritual dance around ad 810 the temple shrine possesses two chambers
temple iv is the tallest temple pyramid at tikal measuring 70 metres 230 ft from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb temple iv marks the reign of yik in chan kawil ruler b the son of ruler a or jasaw chan k awiil i and two carved wooden lintels over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid s summit record a long count date 9 15 10 0 0 that corresponds to ce 741 sharer 1994 169 temple iv is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the maya region in the 8th century and as it currently stands is the tallest pre columbian structure in the americas although the pyramid of the sun at teotihuacan may originally have been taller as may have been one of the structures at el mirador
temple v stands south of the central acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler the temple stands 57 metres 187 ft high making it the second tallest structure at tikal only temple iv is taller the temple has been dated to about ad 700 in the late classic period via radiocarbon analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of nun bak chak in the second half of the 7th century
temple vi is also known as the temple of the inscriptions and was dedicated in ad 766 it is notable for its 12 metre 39 ft high roof comb panels of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof comb the temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is unrestored
temple 33 was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of siyaj chan k awiil i known as burial 48 in the north acropolis it started life in the early classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway later in the early classic a new superstructure was added with its own masks and decorated panels during the hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions the stairway was demolished and another royal burial of an unidentified ruler was set into the structure burial 23 while the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb burial 24 was inserted into the rubble core of the building the pyramid was then completed standing 33 metres 108 ft tall the final version of temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction
structure 34 is a pyramid in the north acropolis that was built by siyaj chan k awiil ii over the tomb of his father yax nuun ayiin i the pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine the rooms situated one behind the other
structure 5d 43 is an unusual radial temple in the east plaza built over a pre existing twin pyramid complex it is built into the end of the east plaza ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways the fourth south side was too close to the central acropolis for a stairway on that side the building has a talud tablero platform profile modified from the original style found at teotihuacan in fact it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer affinities with el tajin and xochicalco than with teotihuacan itself the vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels related to the venus and star symbols used at teotihuacan the roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain showing a monstrous face perhaps that of a jaguar with another head emerging from the mouth the second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake the temple and its associated ballcourt probably date to the reign of nuun ujol chaak or that of his son jasaw chan k awiil i in the later part of the 7th century
structure 5c 49 possesses a clear teotihuacan linked architectural style it has balustrades an architectural feature that is very rare in the maya region and a talud tablero fa ade it dates to the 4th century ad it is located near to the lost world pyramid
structure 5c 53 is a small teotihuacan style platform that dates to about ad 600 it had stairways on all four sides and did not possess a superstructure
the lost world pyramid structure 5c 54 is the largest structure in the mundo perdido complex it lies in the southwest portion of tikal s central core south of temple iii and west of temple v it was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the late preclassic this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un impacted by later building activity at tikal by the end of the late preclassic this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the maya region it attained its final form during the reign of chak tok ich aak in the 4th century ad in the early classic standing more than 30 metres 98 ft high with stairways on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from perishable materials although the plaza later suffered significant alteration the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex adheres to the layout that defines the so called e groups identified as solar observatories
structure 5d 96 is the central temple on the east side of the plaza of the seven temples it has been restored and its rear outer wall is decorated with skull and crossbones motifs
group 6c 16 is an elite residential complex that has been thoroughly excavated it lies a few hundred metres south of the lost world complex and the excavations have revealed elaborate stucco masks ballplayer murals relief sculptures and buildings with teotihuacan characteristics
the great plaza ballcourt is a small ballcourt that lies between temple i and the central acropolis
the bat palace is also known as the palace of windows and lies to the west of temple iii it has two storeys with a double range of chambers on the lower storey and a single range in the upper storey which has been restored the palace has ancient graffiti and possesses low windows
complex n lies to the west of the bat palace and temple iii the complex dates to ad 711

altar 35 is a plain monument associated with stela 43 the stela altar pair is centrally located at the base of the stairway of temple iv
lintels
at tikal beams of sapodilla wood were placed as lintels spanning the inner doorways of temples these are the most elaborately carved wooden lintels to have survived anywhere in the maya region
lintel 3 from temple iv was taken to basel in switzerland in the 19th century it was in almost perfect condition and depicts yik in chan k awiil seated on a palanquin

tropical storm josephine 2008
tropical storm josephine was the tenth tropical storm of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season josephine developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the african coast on august 31 the wave quickly became organized and was declared tropical depression ten while located 170 mi 270 km to the south southeast of the cape verde islands on september 2 the depression was quickly upgraded to tropical storm josephine around noon the same day over the next several days josephine moved in a general west northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on september 3 strong wind shear some due to the outflow of hurricane ike and dry air caused the storm to weaken on september 6 the combination of wind shear dry air and cooling waters caused josephine to weaken into a tropical depression josephine deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm the low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi 835 km east of guadeloupe on september 10 however the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of st croix
meteorological history
tropical storm josephine formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of africa near the end of august 2008 it tracked south of cape verde and slowly developed and on september 2 the disturbance became tropical depression ten while located south southeast of the cape verde islands as the depression became more organized an eye like feature developed in the upper levels of the system the depression was upgraded to tropical storm josephine six hours after forming josephine was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly
josephine continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical however due to the location of the storm there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings and the national hurricane center was uncertain of its actual intensity despite the lack of wind shear around the storm the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification the storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper level trough diving southward despite convection being partially removed from the center of josephine the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on september 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized the intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger
josephine reached its peak intensity of 65 mph 100 km h around 8 a m edt as it continued to become more organized however there were indications that it had already begun to weaken outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm a sign that dry air was entering the system during the afternoon hours the structure of josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll by the late night the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center
despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear a large deep burst of convection formed in the northern semicircle of josephine the center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity the forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 day forecast was predicted however the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and josephine weakened again by the afternoon the center of josephine was only a swirl of clouds devoid of convection during the overnight hours on september 4 into the morning of september 5 convection associated with josephine began to redevelop somewhat mostly to the north of the circulation due to the strong southerly wind shear by mid morning josephine re intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection however the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on josephine by late morning the convection around the system became dislocated from the center and josephine weakened slightly
the weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong southerly shear josephine became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph 65 km h barely holding on to tropical storm status josephine regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm due to the lack of convection josephine was downgraded to a tropical depression at 11p m edt with winds of 35 mph 55 km h since there was no convection around the system it would have normally been classified a remnant low but due to the possibility of the storm regenerating over the next several days it was considered a tropical depression the next morning josephine was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm no redevelopment was expected with josephine as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated
however the remnant low associated with josephine began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on september 7 convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed on september 8 wind shear took over the system again convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more the national hurricane center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed finally on september 9 wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of josephine deteriorating into an open wave however on september 10 the remnants of josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system once more the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of josephine headed towards the bahamas however on september 14 dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely
impact
as josephine passed to the south of the cape verde islands on september 2 outer rain bands produced minor rainfall totaling around 0 55 inches 14 mm there were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor
several days after the low dissipated the remnant moisture from josephine brought showers and thunderstorms to st croix where up to 1 in 25 4 mm of rain fell the heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding no known damage was caused by the flood
mount elbert
mount elbert is the highest summit of the rocky mountains of north america and the highest point in the u s state of colorado and the entire mississippi river drainage basin the ultra prominent 14 440 foot 4401 2 m fourteener is the highest peak in the sawatch range and the second highest summit in the contiguous united states after mount whitney mount elbert is located in san isabel national forest 12 1 miles 19 4 km southwest bearing 223 of the city of leadville in lake county colorado
the mountain was named in honor of colorado statesman samuel hitt elbert who was active in the formative period of the state and governor of the territory of colorado from 1873 to 1874 henry w stuckle of the hayden survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak in 1874 the easiest and most popular climbing routes are categorized as class 1 to 2 or a in mountaineering parlance mount elbert is therefore often referred to as the gentle giant that tops all others in the rocky mountains
geography
mount elbert is visible to the southwest of leadville often snow capped even in the summer many other fourteeners surround elbert in all directions and it is very close to central colorado s collegiate peaks the neighboring mount massive to the north is the second highest peak in the rocky mountains and the third highest in the contiguous united states and la plata peak to the south is the fifth highest in the rockies the community of twin lakes lies at the base of mount elbert denver is about 130 miles 209 km to the east vail is 50 miles 80 km to the north and aspen is 40 miles 64 km to the west leadville about 16 miles 26 km to the northeast is the nearest large town elbert s parent peak is mount whitney in california including alaska and hawaii mount elbert is the fourteenth highest mountain in the united states
weather conditions often change rapidly and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summertime hailstorms and snow are possible year round an electrical storm on the mountain s summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the july 1894 issue of science
geology
mount elbert is part of the sawatch range an uplift of the laramide orogeny which separated from the mosquito range to the east around 28 million years ago the tops of this range were heavily glaciated leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues for example the base of elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded which lie on a lateral moraine further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn there are also lakes to both the north and south turquoise and twin lakes respectively the twin lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines and turquoise lake was created by the manmade sugar loaf dam
mount elbert is composed largely of quartzite however the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock which is pre cambrian in origin and about 1 7 billion years old there are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite as well as bands of gneiss and schist unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north facing cirque which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation
history
mount elbert was named by miners in honor of samuel hitt elbert the governor of the then territory of colorado because he brokered a treaty in september 1873 with the ute tribe that opened up more than 3 000 000 acres 12 000 km2 of reservation land to mining and railroad activity the first recorded ascent of the peak was by h w stuckle in 1874 who was surveying the mountain as part of the hayden survey
originally measured as 14 433 feet 4 399 m in height mount elbert s elevation was later adjusted to 14 440 feet 4 400 m following a re evaluation of mapped elevations which sparked protests the actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the north american vertical datum of 1988 it seems the original measurement resulted from the sea level datum of 1929 a matter of some contention arose after the great depression over the heights of elbert and its neighbor mount massive which differ in elevation by only 12 feet 3 7 m this led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the mount massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height only to have the mount elbert proponents demolish them the effort was ultimately unsuccessful and mount elbert has remained the highest peak in colorado the first motorized ascent of elbert occurred in 1949 when a jeep was driven to the summit apparently to judge suitability for skiing development
flora and fauna
the summit of mount elbert is an alpine environment featuring plants such as phacelia sericea sky pilot hymenoxys grandiflora old man of the mountain and geum rossii alpine avens also noted are carex atrata var pullata salix desertorum platanthera hyperborea thalictrum fendleri aquilegia canadensis chenopodium album gentiana detonsa var hallii and bigelovia parryi below treeline the mountain is heavily forested with the lower slopes covered with a mixture of lodgepole pine spruce aspen and fir
some of the fauna reported on the climb to the summit include black bears marmots mule deer pikas and pocket gophers there are also many species of avifauna elk grouse turkey and bighorn sheep are present in the area during the summer
climbing
there are three main routes which ascend the mountain all of which gain over 4 100 feet 1 200 m of elevation the standard route ascends the peak from the east starting from the colorado trail just north of twin lakes the 4 6 miles 7 4 km long north main elbert trail begins close to the elbert creek campground and gains about 4 500 feet 1 400 m the trail is open to equestrians mountain bikers and hunters during season an easier but longer route the south elbert trail is 5 5 miles 8 9 km long climbing 4 600 feet 1 400 m at a less punishing gradient than the north elbert trail approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge
the most difficult of the main routes is the black cloud trail a class 2 climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending on pace gains 5 300 feet 1 600 m in elevation and also involves an ascent of the sub peak south elbert at 14 134 feet 4 308 m even healthy and experienced climbers report great difficulty on this route and despite the fact that there is a trail the route is extremely steep unstable and rocky in places the elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the 5 5 mile ascent there are also routes approaching from the western face and southwestern ridge from south halfmoon creek trailhead and echo canyon trailhead respectively

the church of scientology has been present in germany since 1970 german authorities estimate that there are 4 000 active scientologists in germany today the church of scientology gives a membership figure of around 12 000 the church of scientology has encountered particular antagonism from the german press and government and occupies a precarious legal social and cultural position in germany
german courts have so far not resolved whether scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or worldview community and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions the german domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization s activities the german government does not recognize scientology as a religion it views it as an abusive business masquerading as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the german constitution this stance has been criticized most notably by the u s government which recognizes scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect filters
scientologists in germany face specific political and economic restrictions they are barred from membership in some major political parties and businesses and other employers use so called sect filters to expose a prospective business partner s or employee s association with the organization german federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning scientology in late 2007 but abandoned the initiative a year later finding insufficient legal grounds despite this polls suggest that most germans favor banning scientology altogether
background
scientology founded in the early 1950s in the united states by l ron hubbard and today claiming to be represented in 150 countries has been a very controversial new religious movement its stated utopian aim is to clear the planet to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations scientology teaches that the source of people s unhappiness lies in engrams psychological burdens acquired in the course of painful experiences which can be cleared through a type of counselling called auditing made available by the church of scientology
the fact that scientologists have to pay large fees for auditing and other scientology services has brought controversy to scientology throughout much of its history with governments classing it as a profit making enterprise rather than as a religion critics maintain that scientology is a business driven psychologically manipulative totalitarian ideology with world dominating aspirations and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for scientology courses scientology has fought innumerable lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion these efforts have been partly successful scientology has gained recognition as a tax exempt religious group in a number of countries most notably in australia in 1983 and the united states in 1993 and in 2007 won an important case at the european court of human rights which censured russia for failing to register scientology as a religion
the german government has said that it does not consider scientology a religion but a commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism whose totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to germany s democratic society accordingly the german government has taken a very strong stance against the organization germany is not alone in opposing scientology in france the church of scientology was convicted of organized fraud in october 2009 after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for scientology products and the church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether scientology is similarly controversial in belgium greece and the uk
on the subject of scientology s status as a religion the german government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the federal labor court of germany that court noting hubbard s instruction that scientologists should make money make more money make other people produce so as to make more money came to the conclusion that scientology purports to be a church merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests in the same decision the court also found that scientology uses inhuman and totalitarian practices given the lessons of germany s 20th century history in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power references in scientology writings to the elimination of parasites and antisocial people who stand in the way of progress towards scientology s utopian world without insanity without criminals and without war evoke uncomfortable parallels with nazism and have led to scientology being classified as an extremist political movement
to further justify its stance the german government has also pointed to the long history of u s court cases involving scientology including the conviction of 11 top scientologists in 1979 and 1980 for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of u s government agencies wiretapping and the theft of government documents a 1994 u s supreme court finding that scientology practices took place in a coercive environment and scientology s track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators in examining the potential threat posed by scientology the german government has noted that scientology organizations are structured so as to make the individual psychologically and financially dependent on a scientology system and that members often abandon contact with friends and family
history
scientology presence in germany
scientology first became active in germany in 1970 by 2007 there were ten major centres scientology churches as well as fourteen minor centres scientology missions in germany the german scientology churches are located in the big cities munich hamburg berlin d sseldorf frankfurt am main hanover and stuttgart of the scientology missions nine are in baden w rttemberg and three in bavaria following german re unification scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former german democratic republic most adherents are found in baden w rttemberg bavaria and north rhine westphalia
scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or vereine in germany their umbrella organisation is the scientology kirche deutschland e v germany s domestic intelligence service the bundesamt f r verfassungsschutz bfv or federal office for the protection of the constitution estimates that there are 4 000 scientologists in germany down from earlier estimates of 5 000 to 6 000 the church of scientology reported around 30 000 members from the mid 1990s onwards this number remained stable for many years however more recently scientology has said it has only 12 000 members discrepancies in scientology membership numbers arise because the church of scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses regardless of their subsequent involvement the number of contractually bound scientology staff members working in german scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred
scientology formulated a clear germany strategy in 1994 similar to equivalent strategies pursued by scientology in other countries and regions of the world with the long term aim of transforming german society in line with the scientological ideal a non pluralist society in which scientology enjoys overriding influence the programme sought to address scientology s image problems in germany to identify weak points in germany that could be exploited for political gain such as germany s national socialist history and to increase both membership figures and political influence in german society with a special emphasis on manoeuvring scientologists into key positions in industry and government as most religions seek to widen their influence in society such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort much like those many religions engage in however according to the bfv the strategy has not had any significant success by 1998 90 government officials had been suspected of being scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed but apart from some isolated cases most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise scientology according to fifka sydora 2009 it is unknown to what degree the clear germany programme is still being pursued
public opposition
german public discourse does not regard scientology as a religion but generally characterizes it as a sekte cult or sect or as an exploitative profit making venture preying on vulnerable minds public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s when widespread debate took place about youth religions such as the unification church iskcon children of god and the divine light mission the most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the sect commissioners sektenbeauftragte of germany s protestant churches who also actively promoted the establishment of private initiatives of parents and concerned persons aktion bildungsinformation educational information campaign became an important organization dedicated to opposing scientology taking an activist stance it warned people not to get involved with scientology filed successful lawsuits against the church of scientology over its proselytizing in public places and published an influential book the sect of scientology and its front organizations in 1981 the organization s founder ingo heinemann became the director of aktion f r geistige und psychische freiheit campaign for intellectual and psychic freedom germany s most prominent anti cult organization warnings from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation as the movements were not doing anything illegal the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious sects the earliest of these publications appearing in 1979
fueled by events such as the waco siege in 1993 the murders and suicides associated with the order of the solar temple and the 1995 aum shinrikyo incidents in japan german fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s with scientology attracting particular attention perceptions that scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when robert vaughn young an american ex scientologist and former pr official in the church of scientology visited german officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in der spiegel a widely read weekly magazine describing scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag the rehabilitation project force for members of scientology s sea org found guilty of transgressions from the mid 1990s onward press articles reports and essays on scientology appeared on an almost daily basis accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience
as noted by the religious scholar hubert seiwert scientology came to be seen as a serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will less zombies but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state this view of scientology as a public enemy seiwert adds became a matter of political correctness senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against scientology and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism stephen a kent writing in 1998 noted that officials at all levels of german government shared the insistence that scientology should be suppressed scientology was viewed as a totalitarian business driven organization guilty of significant human rights abuses officials examining primary and secondary sources legal documents and the testimony of former members concluded that the organization was antithetical to a democratic state federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of scientology
government publications on the dangers of sects increased between 1996 and 1998 and a significant number of them dealt with the church of scientology the german courts had approved such publications in 1989 seeing them as part of the government s responsibility to keep the public informed and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom in 1996 the german parliament launched an enquete enquiry commission to investigate sects and similar groups in large part because of public concerns about scientology its final report published in june 1998 concluded that scientology alone among new religious movements required monitoring by germany s domestic intelligence services
an area of widespread concern in the german media has been the alleged infiltration of businesses by scientologists in line with scientology s declared aim to penetrate society politics and business in preparation for world domination attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium size companies such as estate agents management consultants and management training companies management consultancy firms led by scientologists often conceal their association with scientology once they have recruited members of their clients upper management these managers may send employees to scientology trainers as part of company education and training programmes without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used an expensive commercial version of scientology s oxford capacity analysis usually offered free as part of scientology proselytizing in public places temporarily entered some major german companies who were unaware of its provenance via such a management consultancy firm
in the mid 2000s german sect experts expressed concerns that scientologists were becoming active in the german after school tutoring market these concerns arose because customers of around 20 after school tutoring centres operated by scientologists in frankfurt hamburg stuttgart and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by scientologists using scientology methods brochures advertising the tutoring services would at most mention the name of l ron hubbard the founder of scientology but not scientology itself
in early 2008 thomas gandow sect commissioner of the german lutheran church in berlin and brandenburg and the historian guido knopp both likened the scientologist hollywood actor tom cruise to goebbels the nazi propaganda minister gandow and knopp cited a leaked scientology video in which cruise was seen asking the audience whether scientologists should clean up the world the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers cheers which gandow and knopp felt were reminiscent of the audience s response to goebbels famous question do you want total war gandow s and knopp s comments found few critics in germany most germans consider scientology a subversive organization in 1997 time reported that 70 of germans favoured banning scientology a poll conducted in september 2008 by der spiegel found 67 support for a ban
german scholars such as brigitte sch n and gerald willms have commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around scientology in germany in their view efforts to frame information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities in sch n s words this includes both the efforts of german politicians to enhance their popularity with strong worded statements and scientology s efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution commenting on foreign reporting on scientology in germany she adds that the american press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to american stereotypes both willms and sch n assert that the situation is compounded by the general paucity of scientific studies of scientology sch n as well as irving hexham professor of religious studies at the university of calgary in canada have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by german scholars hexham attributes this situation to the strong influence of the christian churches in germany which has made german academics wary of approaching the subject because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate
in 2010 a german public broadcaster ard showed the film until nothing remains a dramatized account of the effect scientology had on one german family said to be based on a true story the film attracted widespread media attention and a viewership of 8 69 million
legal status
while there have been calls for scientology to be banned the church of scientology remains legal in germany and is allowed to operate there its precise legal status however is unresolved two points are contested first whether or not the teachings of scientology qualify as a religion or worldview religion or weltanschauung these are equal before german law and secondly whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity if the latter were the case this would most likely imply that scientology would not qualify for protection as a religious or worldview community religions oder weltanschauungsgemeinschaft under article 4 of the german constitution which guarantees the freedom of belief religion and worldview status as a religious or worldview community also affects a broad range of other issues in germany such as taxation and freedom of association
the federal court of justice of germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter but implicitly assumed in 1980 that scientology represented a religious or worldview community the upper administrative court in hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that scientology should be viewed as a worldview community in 1995 the federal labor court of germany decided that the church of scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or worldview community entitled to protection under article 4 of the german constitution although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003 in another 2003 decision the administrative court of baden w rttemberg in mannheim said there were no indications that the teachings of scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity in 2005 the federal administrative court of germany explicitly granted a scientologist protection under article 4 1 of the german constitution which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate
many courts have declined to assess the religious status of scientology finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand the federal administrative court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not scientology was a religion was irrelevant and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities the german government does not consider the church of scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that scientology is a profit making enterprise rather than a religion recent years have seen a number of court decisions in scientology s favour despite the very widespread negative attitude to scientology among politicians and the general public
government surveillance
given the history of nazism s rise to power in germany in the 1930s the present german state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the german constitution the bfv domestic intelligence service bundesamt f r verfassungsschutz or federal office for the protection of the constitution regards the aims of scientology as running counter to germany s free and democratic order and has been monitoring scientology since 1997 as have the offices for the protection of the constitution in a number of german l nder minister for family policy claudia nolte instituted the surveillance saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose scientology with all the means at her disposal
the german church of scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court in december 2001 the administrative court in berlin ruled against the berlin office for the protection of the constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the church of scientology berlin as paid informants the court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate in 2003 the same court ruled that it was illegal for the berlin office for the protection of the constitution to include the activities of scientology in its report given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution
at the federal level scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the bfv in november 2004 the federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of scientology as outlined by l ron hubbard in his writings were incompatible with the german constitution lawyers acting for the federal office for the protection of the constitution pointed out that hubbard had written that civil rights for example should be restricted to scientologists and they asserted that the scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti scientology legislation opposing counsel acting for the church of scientology had contended that scientology was non political its aims were the liberation of the human being and that hubbard s instructions were valid only within the church of scientology and were subject to interpretation and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in germany the court disagreed and ruled that many sources some of them not accessible to the general public indicated that the aims of the church of scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights
in saarland surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in 2005 because there is no local branch of scientology and few members as of 6 may 2008 the church of scientology in germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the bfv after the north rhine westphalia higher administrative court in m nster refused to hear an appeal on the matter being suspected of maintaining ambitions against the free democratic basic order the scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its bylaws
there is at least one example of surveillance of scientology by the german intelligence services outside of germany in 1998 the swiss government detained an agent of the german government charging him with carrying out illegal business for a foreign state working for a political information service and falsifying identity documents the german government posted bail for the agent he was eventually given a 30 day suspended jail sentence for spying on scientology and the german government apologized to switzerland for the incident
sect filters
a sect filter also known as a protective declaration schutzerkl rung is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract such sect filters primarily used to screen out scientologists have been drafted by german government agencies for use by businesses sect commissioner s offices exist in germany as part of regional or local government
