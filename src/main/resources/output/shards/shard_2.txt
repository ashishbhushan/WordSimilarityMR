she glanced out almost timorously at the terrace where her husband lounging in a hooded chair had lit a cigar and drawn the russian deerhound s head between his knees
well come while he s not looking she said with a laugh that tried to hide her nervousness and i followed her between the marble emperors of the hall and up the wide stairs with terra cotta nymphs poised among flowers at each landing
in the dimmest corner of her boudoir amid a profusion of delicate and distinguished objects hung one of the familiar oval canvases in the inevitable garlanded frame the mere outline of the frame called up all gisburn s past
mrs gisburn drew back the window curtains moved aside a jardiniere full of pink azaleas pushed an arm chair away and said if you stand here you can just manage to see it i had it over the mantel piece but he wouldn t let it stay
yes i could just manage to see it the first portrait of jack s i had ever had to strain my eyes over usually they had the place of honour say the central panel in a pale yellow or rose dubarry drawing room or a monumental easel placed so that it took the light through curtains of old venetian point the more modest place became the picture better yet as my eyes grew accustomed to the half light all the characteristic qualities came out all the hesitations disguised as audacities the tricks of prestidigitation by which with such consummate skill he managed to divert attention from the real business of the picture to some pretty irrelevance of detail mrs gisburn presenting a neutral surface to work on forming as it were so inevitably the background of her own picture had lent herself in an unusual degree to the display of this false virtuosity the picture was one of jack s strongest as his admirers would have put it it represented on his part a swelling of muscles a congesting of veins a balancing straddling and straining that reminded one of the circus clown s ironic efforts to lift a feather it met in short at every point the demand of lovely woman to be painted strongly because she was tired of being painted sweetly and yet not to lose an atom of the sweetness
it s the last he painted you know mrs gisburn said with pardonable pride the last but one she corrected herself but the other doesn t count because he destroyed it
destroyed it i was about to follow up this clue when i heard a footstep and saw jack himself on the threshold
as he stood there his hands in the pockets of his velveteen coat the thin brown waves of hair pushed back from his white forehead his lean sunburnt cheeks furrowed by a smile that lifted the tips of a self confident moustache i felt to what a degree he had the same quality as his pictures the quality of looking cleverer than he was
his wife glanced at him deprecatingly but his eyes travelled past her to the portrait
mr rickham wanted to see it she began as if excusing herself he shrugged his shoulders still smiling
oh rickham found me out long ago he said lightly then passing his arm through mine come and see the rest of the house
he showed it to me with a kind of naive suburban pride the bath rooms the speaking tubes the dress closets the trouser presses all the complex simplifications of the millionaire s domestic economy and whenever my wonder paid the expected tribute he said throwing out his chest a little yes i really don t see how people manage to live without that
well it was just the end one might have foreseen for him only he was through it all and in spite of it all as he had been through and in spite of his pictures so handsome so charming so disarming that one longed to cry out be dissatisfied with your leisure as once one had longed to say be dissatisfied with your work
but with the cry on my lips my diagnosis suffered an unexpected check
this is my own lair he said leading me into a dark plain room at the end of the florid vista it was square and brown and leathery no effects no bric a brac none of the air of posing for reproduction in a picture weekly above all no least sign of ever having been used as a studio
the fact brought home to me the absolute finality of jack s break with his old life
don t you ever dabble with paint any more i asked still looking about for a trace of such activity
never he said briefly
or water colour or etching
his confident eyes grew dim and his cheeks paled a little under their handsome sunburn
